# Displays plugin

Covers: shell/plugins/vgs.displays/*.qml, shell/plugins/vgs.displays/*.js, shell/plugins/vgs.displays/manifest.json, scripts/test-displays-logic.js, scripts/smoke/rows/displays.sh

`vgs.displays` sets the brightness of each display on its own: a bar widget per screen, a flyout, the brightness keys with an on-screen display, and System → Displays. It runs the brightness helper that [displays.md](displays.md) describes, and nothing else. The plan is [system-plan.md § 3.5](../plans/system-plan.md#35-displays--vgsdisplays-s15s17-s24). [D083](../decisions/D083-brightness-helper-and-uaccess-rule.md) records why a helper runs.

## Parts

| Part | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Service | `Service.qml` | Owns every helper run, the assignments file, the brightness keys, the on-screen display, Identify, the idle dim, the plugin's IPC and every status write. |
| Widget | `Widget.qml` | One per bar. It controls the display on its own screen (`screens.current`): a scroll moves it one `brightnessStep` a notch and shows the on-screen display there, and a click opens the flyout. It hides while no ready display lights its screen. |
| Flyout | `Panel.qml` | One row per display, the display on the flyout's own screen first; Link displays; Display Settings, which opens the plugin's pane. |
| Pane | `Pane.qml` | System → Displays: the rows, a Screen choice and Identify under each display the helper left unplaced or the user placed (`placeable`), Link displays, Dimming, the stale choices, and, while a step is needed, the access entries that need one, each with its action. |
| Rows | `DisplayRow.qml`, `LinkRow.qml` | In the flyout and the pane: one display, a Slider while it is ready, else its state and Allow while its access entry offers it; and Link displays. |
| Layers | `Osd.qml`, `Identify.qml` | The passive layers the service shows through `layers`: a `LevelOsd`, and each screen's name. |
| Logic | `DisplaysLogic.js` | Every decision on this page. |

The surfaces read the status and ask the service through the plugin's IPC: `set` with `{ id, percent, osd? }`, `assign` with `{ device, output }`, where `output` "" forgets the choice, and `identify` with a display id. No surface runs a process.

## Runs

- The helper runs one at a time: `list --outputs -` with `shell.monitors.outputs` on its stdin, or `set ID PERCENT`. A change waits as the latest value per display, in the order each display was first asked. A drag of any length therefore makes the run in flight and one more per display. A list waits behind the changes (`queueSet`, `takeRun`). Omarchy's monitor panel keeps one set in flight and queues the next the same way.
- The service stops a run after 8 s, a bound on a display that never answers, not a measured duration. It logs a run that ends without an answer the judge accepts. After a failed `set` it lists again, since the level shown was the one asked for.
- The service lists again 1 s after the last change of `shell.monitors.outputs`, `shell.system.revision` or `shell.requirements.revision`. A hotplug, an Allow and an install therefore each read the displays again. The first list waits for the outputs and the assignments file.
- While a change waits or runs, the display's published level is the one asked for (`pendingPercent`). A scroll and a linked slider move from that level, and a slider's handle follows it after its own keyboard moves.
- A failed list keeps the last good displays and publishes `failed`. The flyout and the pane then say the displays could not be read, and, while they show displays, that these may be out of date (`listText`).

## Changes

- A slider, a key and a scroll hold a display at 1 % or more, as Omarchy's `clampBrightness` does. A kernel backlight at 0 % turns its panel off.
- A brightness key moves `brightnessStep`, but 1 % at a time up from below 5 % and down from 5 % or below, as Omarchy's `omarchy-brightness-display` does. `keysTarget` `focused` moves the ready display on the output Hyprland focuses (`Hyprland.focusedMonitor`); `all` moves every ready display by its own step.
- A brightness key steps from the level the helper reads next. The press queues a list, and when that list ends every press that waited for it steps, in order, from the levels it read (`keySteps`), or from the last levels when the list failed. A level another program wrote, such as an idle daemon dimming through `brightnessctl`, is therefore the one a key moves from, so a step down and a step up stay equal; Omarchy's `brightnessctl set 5%-` reads the device the same way. A press during a list waits for that list, and a press while the outputs cannot be read does nothing. A press, or a burst of presses during one list, costs one list run before its set, and that list reads every display: one `brightnessctl -l` for the laptop panels, one `ddcutil getvcp` per DDC display, and `ddcutil detect` once its 30 s cache has run out. On a machine with DDC monitors a key on the laptop panel therefore waits for them too.
- The keys are the manifest's `XF86MonBrightnessUp` and `XF86MonBrightnessDown` binds. A user's own bind on the same key shows as a conflict on the Settings page's Keys row, and clearing VGS's key there leaves the user's bind. VGS never edits the user's file.
- While `linked` is on, a change to one display moves every other ready display by the same amount, each held to 1 to 100 (`linkedChanges`).
- A key and a scroll show the on-screen display for 1.5 s, with the first changed display's level, on the outputs that display lights. Under `keysTarget` `all` the display on the focused output changes first, so the on-screen display shows there, or on the first ready display in the helper's order when no ready display lights the focused output. A slider shows none.

## Keys

- System → Displays opens on the first display's slider. Tab follows reading order through each display's slider or Allow, its Screen choice and Identify, Link displays, each saved choice's Forget, and the access actions. Up and Down move a slider and a closed Screen choice.
- The flyout opens on its first slider and takes Tab the same way. The bar item takes no focus.

## Assignments

The helper places what it can ([displays.md § Output mapping](displays.md#output-mapping)). The user places the rest in the pane. The choices live in `plugins/vgs.displays/assignments.json` under `Paths.stateDir`, `${XDG_STATE_HOME}/vgshell`, as `{ "assignments": [{ device, label, output }] }`. `parseAssignments` judges the file: at most 64 entries, each with exactly those three keys as printable text, and one entry per device.

- `device` is an Apple display's USB parent and serial, `usb:<parent>#<serial>`, else its helper id. A unit plugged into another port reads as a new device, so the pane asks again.
- `output` is the output's identifier as the `monitors` capability names it. A tiled Pro Display XDR's two outputs share one identifier, so one choice lights both.
- An entry applies only to a display the helper left unplaced, only while its device and its output are both present, and only while no other display lights that output (`resolve`). The service publishes each entry as `applied`, `stale` (its device or its output is gone) or `unused`. A stale entry stays in the file and never applies; the pane lists it with Forget.
- The pane's Screen choice lists each output identifier once, and leaves out an output a display the helper placed lights. The service's `assign` refuses that output with `reason=taken` (`screenChoices`). An output a user's choice lit stays a choice, since a new choice there moves it.
- A new choice replaces the device's own entry and the entry of any other present device on the same output, and keeps stale entries. Past 64 entries the oldest entry of an absent device goes.
- The service logs a file the judge refuses or it cannot read, and reads it as no choices; the pane says so. The next choice replaces the file. A write that fails keeps the choice until VGS restarts, and the pane says it was not saved (`savedChoicesText`). The first write makes the plugin's state directory: a Quickshell `FileView` write makes the file's parent directories first ([`fileview.cpp`](https://git.outfoxxed.me/quickshell/quickshell/src/tag/v0.3.1/src/io/fileview.cpp) `FileViewWriter::write`, v0.3.1).
- Identify shows every screen's output name and description for 3 s. For that time it moves the chosen display to 10 %, or to 100 % when the display stood below 50 %, then back, so the user sees which screen it lights. A second press ends the first Identify before it reads the display's level, so the display goes back to the user's level. A change to the display while Identify runs is the user's level, and Identify's end keeps it.

## Status

| Key | Type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `displays` | `data` | `{ state, items }`: `state` is `pending`, `ready` or `failed`, the last list's outcome; each item is `{ id, device, label, backend, state, percent, outputs, assigned }` |
| `assignments` | `data` | `{ entries, error }`: each entry with its `state`, and the file's keyed refusal or null |
| `appleAccess` | `state` | The `apple-displays` step; Allow while it reads `needed` or `nixos` |
| `ddcAccess` | `state` | The `i2c-dev` step; Allow while it reads `needed` or `nixos`. `denied` reads "DDC access isn't supported on this system" |
| `ddcTool`, `backlightTool` | `state` | Install while `shell.requirements.missing` names `ddcutil`, or names `brightnessctl` while a backlight reads `missing` |

A display that reads `no-access` shows Allow while the access entry of its backend (`accessKey`) offers it. The flyout and the pane read each access entry's tone, label and offered action from `shell.status.rows`, the Settings page's own rows, and run the action with `shell.status.act`, the plugin's own status action ([status-actions.md](status-actions.md)). The pane draws an access entry only while its value's tone is `warning` or `danger` (`accessNeeded`): its label, its text as the row's message and its action while offered. With no such entry the pane draws no Access section.

## Invariants

1. The runs coalesce: a 20-event drag makes 2 runs, each display keeps its place, a list waits behind the changes, no second run starts while one is in flight, and the level waiting or in flight is the one shown. A key moves the display on the focused output, a linked change moves the others by its delta, the dark end takes 1 % steps, and the presses that waited for one list each step, in order. The judges refuse each malformed helper answer, file and request, and stale and unused entries never apply: an output another display lights takes no second one. Enforced by `scripts/test-displays-logic.js`, with one control per rule, among them: drop the coalescing, put the list first, start a second run, hide the level in flight, ignore the focused output, drop the fine steps, step the waiting presses out of order, lose a waiting press, link by level, apply an entry whose output is gone, whose display the helper placed or whose output another display lights, offer a screen the helper lit, accept one device twice, drop stale entries on a new choice, allow 0 %, drop each judge's rules, map an Apple display to the DDC step, show a step that is ready, never offer brightnessctl, and withhold Allow from a needed step.
2. In the nested sandbox, over the HID fake's Pro Display XDR and two Studio Displays with one serial, `scripts/smoke/rows/displays.sh` reads: no display placed and no widget shown; on the keyboard alone in System → Displays, Up raising the XDR, its slider following a level set elsewhere, and Down on its Screen choice placing it; each bar's widget controlling its own display; a burst of 10 scroll notches from 1 % making at most 2 helper runs, leaving the summed 51 % in the fake and changing no other display, with the on-screen display on that screen alone; a key acting on the focused output; the flyout listing its screen's display first; Identify, a second press during it and a level set while it runs; a closed node reading `no-access`, the pane drawing one access line with Allow from `status.rows`, Allow handed to `core/system`, and no Access section once the node opens again; the choices coming back from the file after the service is rebuilt while the second Studio Display still waits; and, over a stub kernel backlight the `brightnessctl` stand-in lists and sets, a mouse drag on its slider setting it while the drag moves and leaving it at 1 %, then, after another program sets it to 80 %, a key stepping it to 75 % and back to 80 %. Its controls send the 10 notches one run at a time and read 10 runs and the same 51 %, and click the panel's slider with no move and read one set.
