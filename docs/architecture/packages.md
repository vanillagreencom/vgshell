# Packages

Covers: shell/Core/PackageManagers.js, bin/vgshell-pkg, bin/lib/pkg-run.sh, scripts/*vgshell-pkg*

VGS knows a system's package managers through one table, `shell/Core/PackageManagers.js`. Every flow that installs, removes, upgrades or checks a package reads that table: [D034](../decisions/D034-one-package-manager-table.md). `bin/vgshell-pkg` loads it under node through `bin/lib/qml-library.js`, and `vgshell pkg` is its command. Its header states each verb's output and refusals.

## The table

One row per manager: `pacman`, `aur`, `apt`, `dnf`, `xbps`, `emerge`, `nix`, `flatpak` and `mise`. The file's header defines every field.

- A primary serves a system when its family holds the os-release `ID`, or one `ID_LIKE` token, and its binary is on PATH. The identifiers are taken in order, `ID` first, and the first one a row serves decides. A binary alone makes no primary.
- An overlay or a source is present when its binary is on PATH. `aur` is present only beside the `pacman` primary. Its binary is `paru`, else `yay`; `dnf`'s is `dnf5`, else `dnf`.
- No row names an elevation command. A row's `elevate` says whether its steps need root. `aur`, `flatpak` and `mise` do not: each tool asks for root itself when it needs it. `vgshell pkg run` chooses the command that supplies root: [§ Running a plan](#running-a-plan).
- `nix` has no steps and no check: a NixOS system changes through its own configuration. The sudo grant follows the same rule; [tui-sudo.md](tui-sudo.md) names its configuration-only path.
- `packageFor` picks the package that provides a requirement on the detected system: the primary's entry, then an overlay's, then a source's, else none. `PluginLogic.js` imports the table's manager ids and package-name grammar to judge a manifest's `requirements`: [requirements.md](requirements.md).

## Steps

`vgshell pkg plan` prints a plan: each step's argv, in order. It runs nothing.

- Install and remove take one package name or more; upgrade takes none.
- A package name is printable ASCII with no space and never starts with `-`, so no manager reads it as an option.
- A pacman-family step that refreshes the databases also upgrades: `-Syu`, never `-Sy` alone, which is a partial upgrade.
- The steps take no `--noconfirm` or `-y`: the manager asks its own questions in the terminal where the steps run.
- The plan's `elevator` names the elevation command `run` puts before each step: null when `elevate` is false, else that command or the refusal `run` prints. `plan` and `run` take it from one function, so a caller such as the Updates pipeline reads it and does not choose again.

## Running a plan

`vgshell pkg run install|remove|upgrade [--manager <id>] [names...]` runs a plan in the terminal it is typed in. Without `--manager` it takes the detected primary. `vgshell pkg install` and `remove` with names do the same.

- **Where it runs.** Before it reads anything, `run` refuses `caller=shell` when `VGSHELL_RUNNER_PID` is set, and `<verb>=no-terminal` when `/dev/tty` does not open. `vgshell run` exports that variable to the shell, so every process the shell starts carries it. The shell removes it only from the programs it opens for the user: `shell.run.detached` and a floating TUI's terminal ([tui.md](tui.md)). So a plugin process never elevates, and a terminal the user opened from the shell does not refuse.
- **Elevation.** Each step of a row whose `elevate` is true runs behind one command from the table's `ELEVATORS`: `packages.elevate` in `shell.json` ([configuration.md](configuration.md)) when set, else the first of `sudo`, `doas` and `run0` on PATH. A configured command that is absent, or no command at all, is refused before any step runs. A row whose `elevate` is false runs with no elevation command.
- **The runner.** node decides; bash runs. `bin/vgshell-pkg` hands `bin/lib/pkg-run.sh` the elevation command and each step's argv, each led by its length. The steps never pass through a shell string: a name that holds `$(...)` reaches the manager as one word. The steps run from `$HOME`, as a check's queries do, so a project's `mise.toml` in the caller's directory cannot make `mise upgrade` do other than what the check counted. The runner prints each step in the theme accent, stops at the first step that fails and exits with its status.
- **sudo.** A run through `sudo` holds one `vgs_tui_sudo_session` of `bin/lib/tui.sh` for all its steps: the password is asked once, before the first step, and the credential is dropped when the run ends, also after a failure or a Ctrl-C. A one-step run holds one too; one in a TUI's session joins it: [tui.md](tui.md).
- **doas and run0.** Neither has a command that refreshes a credential without running a program as root, so they get no keepalive. Each step asks as the system's rules say: `persist` in `doas.conf`, or polkit's `auth_admin_keep` for `run0`.
- **The ending.** `run` prints no Done or Failed. `vgshell-tui present` prints the ending from the exit status.
- **The rescan.** Once the steps end, however they end, `run` runs `vgshell plugin rescan`, so a running shell reports each requirement the change brought or took away ([requirements.md § Command line](requirements.md#command-line)). A run refused before its steps asks for none, and the exit status stays the steps'.

## Pickers

`vgshell pkg install` and `vgshell pkg remove` with no names open fzf. A row's `picker` names two read-only queries per action: `list` prints the packages, and `preview` prints the details of the package under the cursor.

- The flags, keys and preview layout are Omarchy's `omarchy-pkg-install`, `omarchy-pkg-remove` and `omarchy-pkg-aur-install` (basecamp/omarchy `e332dc97`): `--multi`, the preview in the lower 65 % with `alt-p` to hide it, and `alt-d`, `alt-u`, `alt-j` and `alt-k` to scroll it. The pointer and marker take `VGS_TUI_SUCCESS` for an install and `VGS_TUI_DANGER` for a removal, from the theme's `gum.env`, else fzf's `green` and `red`.
- fzf runs a preview as a shell string. `bin/vgshell-pkg` quotes each preview word and leaves only fzf's `{1}`, which fzf fills and quotes itself. No preview word holds a brace. fzf runs with `SHELL=/bin/sh`, so the quoting holds whatever the user's login shell.
- The picked names go to `run` as argv. Picking nothing exits 0; Esc or Ctrl-C exits 130, so `present` closes the window with no prompt.
- Without `--manager`, install asks first which manager to pick from when an overlay offers a picker beside the primary: the AUR beside pacman. The AUR's steps run through the helper with no elevation command, since the helper asks for root itself.
- pacman, the AUR, apt and dnf have pickers. pacman's remove list is its explicit packages, which include the AUR's, as Omarchy's is. xbps, emerge, nix, flatpak and mise have none: `vgshell pkg install --manager <id> <names>` still runs their steps.
- Omarchy passes `--noconfirm` and joins the picked names through `tr` and `xargs`. VGS lets the manager ask its own questions and hands the names as argv.

## Checks

`vgshell pkg check` counts the updates each detected manager offers, without root: [packages-checks.md](packages-checks.md).

## Queries

A row's `owner` names the package that owns a file, and its `installed` names a package's installed version. Each is an argv and the pattern whose first group reads the answer from the first line the query prints. A row's `removable` is the dry run of removing one package: it exits 0 only when the package is installed and no other installed package requires it. `vgshell pkg removable <package>` runs the primary manager's dry run and prints `{ manager, package, removable }`; any other exit reads false. `vgs.polkit` asks it before it offers to remove another polkit agent: [polkit-agents.md](polkit-agents.md). `vgshell pkg owner <path>` runs the primary manager's two queries and prints `{ manager, package, version }`. Both queries only read the package database. `vgshell self status` asks it which package owns a VGS tree: [distribution-methods.md](distribution-methods.md).

- `installed` answers the upstream version, with no epoch and no packaging revision, so a `vgshell-git` version ends in its commit on every manager.
- The table asks no `installed` query of xbps and emerge, which no VGS package serves, so their `version` is null.
- The table asks the `removable` dry run of pacman alone, `pacman -Rs --print`, as Omarchy's `omarchy-upgrade-to-quattro` does before it removes a retired package (basecamp/omarchy `6520ac7d`). Read on host cachy on 2026-10-04 with pacman 7.1.0: it exits 0 for a package nothing requires and 1, naming each package that requires it, otherwise. Every other manager refuses the query as unsupported, so its caller never reads a package removable.
- A query that exits non-zero refuses with the query's own stderr after the line. Every owner query exits non-zero for a file no package owns.

The outputs the patterns read come from each tool's own documentation:

- `pacman -Qoq` prints the owner's name, and `pacman -Q <name>` prints `<name> [<epoch>:]<pkgver>-<pkgrel>`, pacman(8).
- `dpkg -S` prints `<package>[:<arch>]: <path>`, and `dpkg-query -W --showformat='${Version}\n'` prints `[<epoch>:]<upstream>[-<revision>]`, dpkg-query(1) and deb-version(7).
- `rpm -qf --queryformat '%{NAME}\n'` and `rpm -q --queryformat '%{VERSION}\n'` print the tag alone, rpm(8).
- `xbps-query -o` prints `<pkgver>: <path>`, with `<pkgver>` the package's name, `-`, its version and `_<revision>`, xbps-query(1) and xbps `bin/xbps-query/ownedby.c`.
- `qfile` prints `<category>/<package> (<path>)`, the Gentoo wiki's Q applets page.

## Boundary

The shell process never elevates for a package. The table names no elevation command, and only `vgshell pkg run`, `install` and `remove` change a package: they refuse in a process the shell started and without a terminal, so a package change runs only where the user answers the prompt. The core opens the pickers as the floating TUIs `core/pkg-install` and `core/pkg-remove` ([tui.md](tui.md)). The one elevation a shell process performs is the Chromium policy writer's `sudo -n`, [D029](../decisions/D029-chromium-policy-writer.md), which changes no package.

## Invariants

1. The table names no elevation command in a step or a picker, no pacman-family step refreshes without upgrading, and no preview word holds a brace. Enforced by the table suite `scripts/test-vgshell-pkg-table.js`, which judges the shipped table, with a copy planting `-Sy`, a copy planting `sudo` in a step and in a picker, and a copy planting `{q}` in a preview as its controls.
2. Each manager's plan is the argv its row states. Enforced by the table suite's plan rows, one per manager and action.
3. Detection takes the first os-release identifier a present primary serves. Enforced by the table suite's detection rows and, for the command, by the CLI suite `scripts/test-vgshell-pkg-cli.js` with a fixture os-release bound over `/etc/os-release` under `unshare -rm`.
4. Each manager's owner and installed queries are the argv its row states, and each reads its manager's output. Enforced by the table suite's query and answer rows, and for `vgshell pkg owner` by the CLI suite's stub `pacman` and `xbps-query` commands under fixture os-release files. Its controls are a copy whose answer ignores the pattern and a copy of `bin/vgshell-pkg` that asks no installed version. The removable query's argv and name grammar are the table suite's, and `vgshell pkg removable`'s answer by exit status the CLI suite's, whose control is a copy that answers true whatever the dry run's exit.
5. `run` refuses without a terminal and in a process the shell started, before any command runs. Enforced by `scripts/test-vgshell-pkg-run.sh` with stub elevation commands and managers that record their argv, with a copy that skips the terminal test and a copy that ignores `VGSHELL_RUNNER_PID` as controls.
6. A sudo run asks once and drops the credential at the end, the first failing step ends the run, a step reaches the manager as argv, and a row with `elevate` false runs with no elevation command. Enforced by the same suite, with copies that hold no sudo session, run past a failure, run a step through `bash -c` and always elevate.
7. The elevation command is `packages.elevate`, else the first of `sudo`, `doas` and `run0` on PATH; `PluginLogic.configError` refuses any other value. Enforced by the table suite's elevator rows, the run suite's rows and `scripts/test-plugin-logic.js`, each with its own control.
8. A picker offers the table's list, previews through the table's quoted query, colours from `gum.env` and runs nothing when left. Enforced by the run suite with a stub fzf, with copies that leave the preview unquoted, ignore the colour and run after Esc.
