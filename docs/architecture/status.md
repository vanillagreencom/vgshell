# Plugin status

Covers: shell/Core/PluginStatus.qml, shell/plugins/vgs.settings/StatusRow.qml, shell/plugins/vgs.settings/StatusLine.qml, scripts/smoke/rows/status.sh, scripts/smoke/fixtures/plugins/acme.status/**, scripts/test-plugin-status.js

The runtime values a plugin publishes for its own instances and for its Settings page: a pending count, whether a check runs, whether a credential is stored. A plugin declares each value in its manifest, one instance writes it through the `status` capability, the core holds one record per plugin, and every instance of the plugin and the Settings window read that record. [D037](../decisions/D037-plugin-status.md) records the choice and refines [D032](../decisions/D032-settings-plugin-and-manifest-settings-convention.md); it also adds the `presenceList` type, and [D061](../decisions/D061-no-manual-commands.md) the actions and secrets that make a setup step one click.

## Declared

The manifest's `status` key maps a status key to `{ type, label, group?, hint?, action?, actions?, command?, hidden? }`. `PluginLogic.validateManifest` judges it; `scripts/test-plugin-logic.js` pins each refusal by its text.

- A key matches `PluginLogic.STATUS_KEY_PATTERN`, a plain identifier such as `slackTokens`.
- `type` is one of `PluginLogic.STATUS_TYPES`, the table below. `label` and `group` are printable lines of at most 60 characters, `hint` of at most 200, `command` of at most 300. `hidden` keeps a typed entry off the Settings page.
- `action` is the entry's one-click setup step, on a `presence` or `state` entry alone: `{ label, tui }`, one of the manifest's own `tui` scripts, `{ label, install }`, a list of its own requirement commands, each once, or `{ label, system }`, a step of its own `systemSteps` ([system-steps.md](system-steps.md)). `PluginLogic.statusActionError` judges it.
- `actions`, on a `state` entry alone and in place of `action`, is two or more such steps by name, `{ <name>: { label, tui | install | system } }`, for a row whose step differs by what its writer found. The value names the one that applies. It takes no `command`, which would stand for one of them alone.
- `command` is text, and needs an `action`: the page shows it only behind that action's Show command disclosure, a `CommandDisclosure`, and never runs it.
- A `data` entry carries no `group`, `hint`, `action`, `command` or `hidden`, because the page never draws it.
- `status` needs capability `status`, and capability `status` needs at least one entry.

| Type | Value | Tone on the page |
|---|---|---|
| `presence` | `present`, `absent`, `locked`, `unavailable` or `unsafe` | `success`, `warning`, `info`, `neutral`, `danger`, from `PluginLogic.STATUS_PRESENCE_TONES` |
| `presenceList` | a list of at most `PluginLogic.STATUS_LIST_MAX`, 32, items `{ label, value, hint?, secret?, command? }`, below | none of its own; each item the tone of its `value`, as a `presence` |
| `state` | `{ tone, text, lines?, action? }`: `tone` one of `ok`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`, a printable `text` of at most 200 characters, `lines`, 1 to 32 further such lines for a state that names several things, and `action`: a boolean, only for an entry that declares `action`, or the name of one of the entry's `actions` | `success`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`, from `PluginLogic.STATUS_STATE_TONES` |
| `text` | a printable line of at most 200 characters | none |
| `count` | a whole number from 0 | none |
| `time` | whole milliseconds since the Unix epoch, as `Date.now()` answers | none; drawn as the local short date and time |
| `data` | plain JSON: null, booleans, finite numbers, strings, arrays and plain objects | never drawn |
| `choices` | a list of at most `PluginLogic.STATUS_LIST_MAX` items `{ label, value }` | a setting's Select, never a Status row |

A `presence` value answers whether a credential is stored without its value: stored and readable, not stored, stored in a locked collection a background probe must not unlock, a store that cannot be asked, or stored where another user can read it. D037 gives each value's meaning and tone.

A `presenceList` value is one `presence` per thing the manifest cannot list ahead, such as one credential per account the plugin finds. Each item carries only `STATUS_LIST_ITEM_KEYS`: a `label`, a printable line of at most 60 characters; a `value`, a `presence` value; and, when present, a `hint` of at most 200, a `secret`, the account of the manifest's `secrets` the item is the presence of, matching `PluginLogic.SECRET_ACCOUNT_PATTERN`, and a `command` of at most 300, which needs the `secret`. `PluginLogic.statusValueFits` judges each item, and `statusWrite` refuses a `secret` from a manifest without `secrets`, a state's boolean `action` for an entry without one and a name its `actions` do not hold, as `type`.

## Actions and secrets

An entry's `action`, its `command` and a manifest's `secrets`, the one-click setup steps the Settings page draws: [status.md](status.md).

## Setting choices

A string schema entry's `optionsFrom` names a `choices` status key of the same plugin, including a hidden entry. `PluginLogic.schemaError` refuses another type, a malformed key, an undeclared key or a key of another status type. Static `options` remains enum-only. [D057](../decisions/D057-setting-options-from-status.md) refines D032 and D037.

- Each choice holds only `label` and `value`. Both are non-empty printable lines. A label fits `STATUS_LABEL_MAX`, and a value fits `STATUS_TEXT_MAX`. Values are distinct; labels may repeat. An empty list is valid. `PluginLogic.statusValueFits` judges the list under the existing status byte ceiling.
- `Registry.managerRows.settingChoices` holds one Select model per string with `optionsFrom`, built by `PluginLogic.settingChoices`. It copies the accepted offers, adds an empty-string first-offered entry before them when there is one, and adds the configured id marked unavailable when it is not offered; with no offer and no configured id the model is empty. Unreported or disabled status supplies no offers. The models never reach the status record or configuration by reference.
- A `list` entry's key holds one map per item, in the list's order, from each of its item fields with `optionsFrom` to that field's Select model, built from the item's own value by the same rules (`Pads.listChoices`). A value that is no list has no maps.
- Empty string means the first offered value. The plugin consuming the setting resolves it from its own status; with no offer it has no selected value. The core delivers the configured string unchanged. It never stores the first offer.
- A status update, a renamed label, reordered offers, an empty list, disable or source replacement changes no setting. A configured id no longer offered stays visible and stored. The string setting judge still accepts it.
- `SettingField` draws the existing `qs.Ui` Select, whose `emptyText` reads one plain line while the model is empty. `Select.activated` applies the selected id only on a user choice, never on a model or binding change. The editor restores its index binding after the choice, so a refused save shows the configured value again.

`scripts/test-plugin-logic.js` and `scripts/test-plugin-status.js` pin these rules with must-fail controls. `scripts/smoke/rows/settings.sh` reads the drawn model, saved id, unavailable value and no-write refreshes from `acme.status`. `scripts/smoke/rows/status.sh` reads the list from every instance and verifies reader isolation.

## Published

- `shell.status.set(key, value)` answers `ok` or one keyed line, `refused: status=<key> reason=<reason>`: `undeclared` for a key the manifest does not declare, `type` for a value that does not fit its type, `size` for values whose JSON would pass `PluginLogic.STATUS_MAX_BYTES`, 64 KiB, and `retired` for a write from an instance whose plugin is disabled or whose source revision was replaced. A refused write changes nothing. `PluginLogic.statusWrite` judges the first three.
- `shell.status.act(key)` runs the plugin's own action of entry `key`: [status.md](status.md).
- `shell.status.rows` is the plugin's own Status rows as the Settings page draws them, `PluginLogic.statusRows` over its active manifest and published values: each displayable entry's label, group, tone and `action` with its label and whether it is offered. A plugin's own surface that draws an entry takes these, so the tone and the offered rule have one owner. It reads `shell.status.values`, so a binding on it follows every write.
- `shell.status.values` is the plugin's published values, and an empty object before the first write. Each read answers a deep-frozen copy of its own, which neither the writer nor another reader can reach: the engine lets a frozen array be written in place ([runtime-qml.md](runtime-qml.md)), so a reader that changes an array changes only its copy. `shell.status.revision` is the serial of the last write, 0 before one. Both are bindable: a binding that reads them re-evaluates on every write.
- `PluginStatus.qml` holds one record per plugin id. The record lives while the plugin is enabled at the source revision that wrote it. Disabling the plugin, or a rescan that gives it a new revision, drops it, and the rebuilt service publishes again from nothing. Nothing is written to disk.
- The lending record, `vgshell ipc call shell lent`, lists each record under `status` with its keys, its revision and its size in bytes.

## Convention

- The service writes. Bar widgets, flyouts and the Settings page read.
- One writer per key: a value that two instances write has two answers.
- A credential's value never enters status. Its presence does, from a probe that does not read it.
- A value that must survive a restart lives in the plugin's own state file, and the service publishes it again at start.

## Shown

- `Registry.managerRows` gives each plugin `status`, `PluginLogic.statusRows` over `Registry.activeManifestOf`, the manifest without the entries of an owner-only extra that is off ([D075](../decisions/D075-consumer-features-need-no-developer-setup.md)); the manager's action and secret steps judge that view too, so they refuse such an entry as `undeclared`: one row per entry that is not `data`, `choices` or `hidden`, in manifest order, `{ key, type, label, group, hint, command, action, report, value, tone }`, `report` `reported` or `unreported` and `action` null or `{ label, offered }`. A reported `presenceList` row's `value` is its items, each `{ label, value, hint, command, tone, secret, access }` with `hint`, `command` and `secret` "" when the item omits them, `tone` its presence's and `access` `connect`, `disconnect` or ""; the row's own `tone` is "". Beside `status`, each plugin's manager row carries `secretLabel`, the manifest's `secrets` label or "", which a Connect's field asks for.
- The Settings page draws a Status section on the plugin's Details page: one `StatusRow` per row, entries without a `group` first under `Status`, then each group in the order its first entry appears. A row draws `StatusLine`s: the label beside the value, a `Badge` in the row's tone for `presence` and `state`, one more for each of a state's `lines`, and a line of text otherwise, the hint under it and, while the action is offered, its button and the command behind Show command. A `presenceList` row draws its label and hint, "None detected" while the list is empty, then one line per item: the item's label beside a `Badge` of its presence, its hint, Connect or Disconnect by its access, and its command behind Show command while that access is Connect. [settings-window.md](settings-window.md) holds the rule. Connect opens one masked `TextField` on the line, whose Save or Enter hands what was typed to `storeSecret` and closes it. A refused or failed step reads under its line until a later step there succeeds. An unreported row, and every row of a disabled plugin, reads "Not reported". No row edits a value: its only input is a Connect's field.

## Invariants

1. Every instance of a plugin reads one record: the service, a bar widget on each of two screens and a summoned panel read one revision and one set of values. Enforced by `scripts/smoke/rows/status.sh`.
2. Only a declared key with a value of its type, inside the ceiling, is published; the published values do not change in place. Enforced by `scripts/test-plugin-status.js`, each rule with a control, and by `scripts/smoke/rows/status.sh`, which reads each refusal by its text.
3. A disabled plugin holds no record, a new source revision drops it, and a retired instance's write cannot bring it back. Enforced by `scripts/smoke/rows/status.sh`, from the lending record.
4. The Status section draws no `data`, `choices` or hidden entry and no row edits a value; a command draws only behind Show command. Enforced by `scripts/test-plugin-status.js`, by `scripts/test-plugin-logic.js`, which refuses a `command` without an `action`, and by `scripts/smoke/rows/settings.sh`.
5. A `presenceList` item holds only its keys, a label and a presence, and its row carries each item's tone and its secret's access. Enforced by `scripts/test-plugin-status.js`, each rule with a control.
