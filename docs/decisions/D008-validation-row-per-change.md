# D008: Every change carries its validation row and runs only in the nested sandbox

[← Decision Index](INDEX.md)

**Date**: 2026-09-21

**Status**: Superseded by D100

**Research**: —

**Context**: Validation per release finds a regression long after the change that made it, and a second shell started against the live session can blank the desktop.

**Decision**: A change that adds a surface, a service or a plugin adds its row under `scripts/smoke/rows/` in the same PR; a change that adds a check adds its row to `scripts/validate`. `scripts/qml-smoke.sh` runs those rows through `scripts/smoke/harness.sh`, the owner of shell startup and teardown, in a nested Hyprland with its own runtime dir, built from the repository alone. Every budget a script or document states was measured by that script on the machine and date it names.

**Rationale**:

- Per-change checks catch a regression in the change that made it.
- A sandbox whose verdict depends on the machine it ran on is not a sandbox.

**Revisit When**: CI gains a Wayland-capable runner, or a check needs host state the sandbox cannot reproduce.

**Verification**: `scripts/validate all`; the smoke's resident-size ceiling names its measurement.
