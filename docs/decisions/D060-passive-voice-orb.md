# D060: VoiceOrb is a generic passive visual in qs.Ui

**Date**: 2026-09-30
**Status**: Active
**Research**: [Jarvis plan §10](../plans/jarvis-plan.md#10-decisions-to-record)
**Refines**: [D015](D015-tokens-are-a-judged-table.md), [D026](D026-passive-layers-are-a-capability.md)

**Context**: A listening indicator needs a reusable visual before a voice plugin or its bubble exists. The indicator must remain useful under reduced motion and must not take a press from the application below a passive layer.

**Decision**: `VoiceOrb` in `qs.Ui` is decorative. Its inputs are tone, primary level, secondary level and active state. One baked fragment shader draws a thin ring and fine concentric arcs from `voiceOrb` tokens. Its frame driver runs only in a visible, non-minimized host while the component is visible, active and motion is enabled. It has no pointer handler, mute action, accessible control or microphone dependency. A plugin places labelled actions outside it.

**Rationale**:
- A generic component keeps voice state and audio ownership out of the core. The caller maps its state to palette-derived tones.
- A click to mute on the decoration is not discoverable and could take input from another application. A mute key or labelled control remains available when the visual is absent.
- The owner's shader references supply the uniform model and attack/release smoothing approach. Their fixed palettes, noise layers and volumetric march do not fit a token-driven line visual.
- The read-only Omarchy quattro reference has a component Gallery and audio controls, but no voice-orb counterpart. VGS keeps its composition approach and adds this component for the plan's passive indicator.
- A QML shape stack or a Canvas is an alternative, but the plan selects one analytic shader. It needs no texture, blur or iteration. GPU measurement and presentation checks belong to J08; this record claims no cost budget.

**Revisit When**: A consumer needs an interactive visual, or J08's GPU readings require a different rendering mechanism.

**Verification**: `scripts/qml-tests/tst_voiceorb.qml` reads properties and animation lifetime, with mutations in `scripts/test-qml-unit.sh`. `scripts/check-voiceorb-shader.py` compiles and checks the shipped pack, with controls in `scripts/test-check-voiceorb-shader.py`. `scripts/smoke/rows/gallery.sh` captures each example's actual tone pixels, beside a control that must draw before its shader is hidden. The read-only prefix row runs the installed component.

## Bubble composition

`Bubble.qml` composes the generic orb in the service's passive layer. Only the labelled Mute and Stop controls enter the input union. Their global keys remain available while no bubble maps. The orb, text and gaps take no press. The service builds no bar widget to obtain its indicator.

The [bubble contract](../architecture/jarvis-bubble.md) defines presentation and its controls. The read-only Omarchy OSD uses the same bottom-centred, keyboard-passive composition. VGS uses the generic host's reserved-space handling and input-item union rather than local bar geometry or an entirely empty region.
