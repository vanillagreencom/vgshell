# D005: Kinds are surfaces and plugins declare no dependencies

[← Decision Index](INDEX.md)

**Date**: 2026-09-21

**Status**: Revisited

**Research**: —

**Context**: A first design let a plugin require another by id and had the manager refuse to disable a required plugin. The owner rejected that as a flat structure was simpler and a plugin should keep working when part of it has nowhere to draw.

**Decision**: A plugin declares the kinds it can fill, from the list `PluginLogic.KINDS` holds and `docs/architecture/overview.md` § Vocabulary states. The core owns the list; a new kind is a core change with its own host. A kind whose host is absent is not shown and the plugin's other kinds keep working. A manifest `requires` key is refused. Disabling the active bar answers with the widgets it hides; they stay enabled.

**Rationale**:

- A closed kind list lets the core own placement, lifecycle and per-kind scoping.
- No dependency graph means no load order to derive, no refusal to explain, and no plugin that names another.

**Revisit When**: A plugin genuinely cannot work without another plugin's service and no core capability can carry that contract.

**Verification**: `scripts/test-plugin-logic.js` pins the `requires` refusal and `hiddenByDisabling`; `scripts/smoke/rows/bar.sh` asserts the hidden-widgets reply.

## Revisit Outcome (2026-09-25)

The decision holds. The kind list gained `background` when its host landed; the list is `PluginLogic.KINDS`, and the overview's vocabulary entry is the one prose list of it; the per-kind tables in `docs/architecture/plugins.md` § Kinds and the plugin skill's API reference describe each kind's host. A built-in widget a plugin draws itself is not a kind: [D013](D013-built-in-widgets-are-the-bar-plugins.md).

## Revisit Outcome (2026-09-28)

The decision holds. [D035](D035-manifest-requirements.md) adds a manifest `requirements` key for the external commands a plugin runs; a requirement names a command and the packages that provide it, never a plugin. A plugin still names no plugin: `requires` is refused by name, and a requirement whose command is spelt as a plugin id is refused. `scripts/test-plugin-logic.js` pins both refusals.
