# D048: Themes own bounded Hyprland appearance groups through manifest switches

**Context**: A theme already sets Hyprland border colours through the generated layer. It did not set border thickness, window corners, grouped-window tab corners or motion. The owner needed theme packages to carry those values without taking over layout, gaps, blur strength, opacity, cursor, fonts or user keybinds.

**Decision**: Theme documents gain a top-level `hyprland` token group. The generated Hyprland layer writes three fixed appearance groups in this order: `borders`, `radius`, `motion`.

- `borders` writes the existing border colours, `general.border_size` and `decoration.shadow.color`. Shadow colour follows the palette. Shadow enabled state and shadow size stay the user's.
- `radius` writes `decoration.rounding`, `decoration.rounding_power`, `group.groupbar.rounding` and `group.groupbar.gradient_rounding`.
- `motion` writes one VGS preset, `none`, `snappy` or `smooth`, for window, layer, workspace and fade animation leaves. `global` and `border` stay the user's.

The `vgs.themes` manifest declares three Settings switches: window borders default on, corner radius default on, and window animations default off. Its `hyprland.appearance` object maps each appearance group to the boolean schema key that controls it. The manifest judge accepts only the fixed group names, only boolean schema keys and only a plugin with capability `theme`.

The core does not name `vgs.themes`. Among enabled plugin sections that declare `hyprland.appearance`, the first plugin by id owns the switches. Later declarations are reported as Hyprland problems and ignored. If no enabled plugin declares a group, the core defaults apply: borders on, radius on and motion off.

**Rationale**:

- A manifest declaration keeps the core's plugin boundary intact. The boundary check rejects core literals that name a `vgs.*` plugin id.
- A core `shell.json` key would need bespoke Settings UI. Manifest schema already draws plugin settings, per [D032](D032-settings-plugin-and-manifest-settings-convention.md).
- Hyprland window radius is its own token, `hyprland.window.radius`, with default `{radius.md}`. Panels and windows match by default, and a theme can separate them. The token is bounded from 0 to 32 because Hyprland accepts large rounding values but desktop windows above that range stop reading as the shell's medium panel radius. A theme that sets `radius.md` above 32 is refused on `hyprland.window.radius` unless it also sets `hyprland.window.radius` within 0 to 32. The refusal is loud because clamping would silently make shell panels and Hyprland windows disagree while the theme file appears accepted.
- Grouped-window tabs use the window radius times the highest Hyprland monitor scale, bounded 0 to 20. Hyprland scales window corners per monitor but not group bar tabs, so one generated tab value must fit the highest-scale monitor.
- Motion presets keep raw bezier text out of theme files. The theme chooses a judged enum, and the core formats numbers and names every curve with a `vgs` prefix so a user curve cannot collide with it.
- `motion.scale` multiplies Hyprland speeds. A scale of 0 acts as `none`.
- A disabled group writes no `hl.*` call. Hyprland resets options to defaults before each Lua reload, then reruns the user's file, so an omitted group returns to the user's setting after the VGS include line, or Hyprland's default when the user sets none.

## Motion presets

| Preset | Effect |
|---|---|
| `none` | Writes `animations.enabled = false`. |
| `snappy` | Uses short VGS curves and shorter speeds for windows, layers, fades and workspaces. |
| `smooth` | Uses Omarchy's default `easeOutQuint`, `almostLinear`, `quick` and `linear` curves and its window, layer and fade speeds. VGS differs by enabling a workspace leaf in the preset, while Omarchy disables workspace animation. |

## Omarchy comparison

Checked against basecamp/omarchy `b421b1b`.

| Omarchy | VGS | Difference |
|---|---|---|
| `default/hypr/looknfeel.lua` sets border size, default animations and curves directly in Lua. | VGS renders judged theme tokens through one generated layer. | VGS keeps theme files as data, not Lua code. |
| `themes/solitude/hyprland.lua` sets raw Lua border colours plus `rounding = 6` and `rounding_power = 3`. | VGS packages set `hyprland.window.radius` and `hyprland.window.roundingPower` tokens. | VGS refuses unknown keys and out-of-range values before Lua is written. |
| Omarchy owns the user's Hyprland configuration order. | VGS owns one include line loaded first. | A user's setting after the include still wins. |

## What stays the user's

Gaps, layouts, blur amount, opacity, cursor theme and size, fonts, global animation defaults, border animation, shadow enabled state and shadow size stay outside the theme tokens. A fourth group, `noGaps`, is no theme value: it writes zero gaps only while the owner turns `vgs.themes`' No window gaps on, and a theme apply leaves it as it is ([hyprland.md](../architecture/hyprland.md)).

**Revisit When**: A second compositor is supported, Hyprland drops Lua appearance functions used by the layer, or a theme must set layout-affecting values.

**Verification**: `scripts/test-theme-logic.js` covers the tokens, bounded lengths and refused unknown `hyprland` keys. `scripts/test-hyprland-layer.js` covers manifest `hyprland.appearance`, owner resolution, group switches, section order, radius scaling and motion presets. `scripts/smoke/rows/hyprland.sh` reads `border_size`, `rounding`, animations and `configerrors` from the nested compositor.
