# D061: No manual commands: a setup step is automatic or one click, and a command only a "Show command" disclosure

[← Decision Index](INDEX.md)

**Date**: 2026-09-30

**Status**: Active

**Research**: [VGS-613](https://linear.app/vanillagreen/issue/VGS-613)

**Refines**: [D033](D033-floating-tuis-are-core.md), [D035](D035-manifest-requirements.md), [D037](D037-plugin-status.md)

**Context**: Installing VGS or a plugin told the user to run commands by hand: `secret-tool store … account slack:<team>` for Slack photos, `loginctl enable-linger` for automations while logged out, `vsys warden install` and a `curl … | bash` for Agent Warden, `vgsh theme browser-policy install` for Chromium theming, `vgsh pkg run install mise`, and `vgsh plugin enable <id>` for bar widgets. Each sat in a README, a Settings status row's `command` or a hint. The owner's direction: a user installing a plugin should run no command; at worst they press a button that runs it for them. Pasting a token into a shell command also puts it in the shell's history.

**Decision**: One standing rule, and the mechanism that makes it hold.

- **The rule.** A user-facing setup step is automatic, or one click in the user interface: a Settings row, a notice or a dialog button. A step that needs a privilege or asks a question in a terminal runs in a core floating TUI ([D033](D033-floating-tuis-are-core.md)) or through the requirement notice ([D035](D035-manifest-requirements.md)), which that button starts. A secret is typed into a masked field and VGS stores it in libsecret; it never goes into a command the user runs. A copyable command appears only as a secondary "Show command" disclosure beside the button that runs its step.
- **Status actions.** A `presence` or `state` status entry may declare `action: { label, tui | install }`: `tui` names one of the plugin's own `tui` scripts, `install` a list of its own requirement commands. The plugin, the one writer of the value, says when it applies: a `presence` while `absent`, a `state` while its value carries `action: true`. The Settings page draws the action as a button, and the `manager` capability's `act(id, key)` runs it: the core opens the plugin's own TUI, as the plugin's `shell.tui.run` would, or raises the requirement notice for those commands. A status `command` needs an `action`, and a `presenceList` item's `command` needs its `secret`, so no command stands alone; the page shows it behind Show command, in `qs.Ui`'s `CommandDisclosure`.
- **Secrets.** A manifest's `secrets: { service, label }`, with capability `secrets`, declares the libsecret items VGS stores for the plugin. A `presenceList` item names its account as `secret`. The Settings page offers Connect while the item is `absent`, which opens a masked `TextField`, and Disconnect while something is stored. The `manager` capability's `storeSecret` and `clearSecret` hand the request to the core's one writer, `SecretWriter`, which runs `secret-tool store` with the account on its argv and the secret on stdin, then closes stdin, or `secret-tool clear`. `PluginLogic.secretRequest` writes only an account the plugin itself lists, and only the verb its presence offers. The plugin reads `shell.secrets.revision`, which each ended write raises, and probes its store again.
- **Enforcement.** `scripts/check-user-commands.py` fails where a plugin's Markdown, its manifest's user-facing strings or a drawn string of shipped QML or JavaScript tells the user to run a command, outside a `<details>` block whose summary is Show command. `PluginLogic.statusError` refuses a status `command` without an `action`.

**Rationale**:

- The core already owns every route a setup step needs: floating TUIs for questions and passwords, the requirement notice for packages, and status rows on the Settings page. The action names one of them as data, so a plugin adds a button with no interface code, and the core never runs a command string from a manifest.
- The plugin decides when its step applies, because it owns the value that says so: a warden not set up, lingering off, a token absent. The core decides only whether the button's request is one the value offers, and refuses the rest, so the button cannot run a step the page did not show.
- A secret typed into the shell never touches an argv, a log line or a status value. One core writer serves every plugin that declares a credential; a plugin reimplementing its own `secret-tool` call is a second copy of the same verb.
- Keeping the command behind Show command serves the user who wants it, such as someone scripting a setup or on a system with no package for the step, without making it the path.

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Why rejected |
|---|---|
| A generic `run` action whose argv the manifest declares | The shell would run plugin-supplied commands outside a terminal, with no place to show a question, a password prompt or an error. A TUI script already carries the argv, and the terminal shows its output. |
| Buttons in each plugin's own panel only | Each plugin would build its own button, and a plugin without a panel, such as Automations, would have none. The Settings page draws every plugin the same way from the manifest. |
| A floating TUI with a masked `gum input --password` for the Slack token | This is a terminal the user did not need, for a step with no question. A masked field on the page is the step itself. |
| The token handed to the plugin's own IPC handler, which stores it | Every plugin with a credential would write its own `secret-tool` call. An IPC function that takes a secret can also be called from a shell, which puts the secret on an argv. |
| A tone rule: offer the action while the row's tone is not success | The tones mean different things across plugins: a warden that stopped checking is a warning that Set up does not fix. The writer knows which states its step fixes. |

## Omarchy comparison

Omarchy (basecamp/omarchy `quattro`, `shell/plugins/panels/network/Panel.qml`) enters a Wi-Fi passphrase in a row-embedded masked `TextField` (`password: true`) and hands it to `nmcli` over stdin, "never argv". VGS takes the same field and the same stdin rule for libsecret. Omarchy's menu runs setup steps as `omarchy-*` commands from menu entries in a floating terminal; VGS keeps that terminal for steps that ask, and names the step as manifest data rather than an action string.

**Revisit When**: A setup step needs input the masked field and a TUI cannot take, such as a file picker or an OAuth browser round trip; or a second secret store beside libsecret is needed.

**Verification**: `scripts/test-plugin-status.js` and `scripts/test-plugin-logic.js` pin every action and secret rule with a control; `scripts/check-user-commands.py` and `scripts/test-check-user-commands.py` hold the text rule with a control per rule; in the nested sandbox, where `scripts/qml-smoke.sh` hides the host's `vsys` and browser-policy writer so each press runs on any host, `scripts/smoke/rows/settings.sh` presses the status fixture's Set up token and Install the tool, the Automations row Enable while logged out, the Agent Warden row Set up, and Install all missing for vsys, the Themes row Install browser theming and the Notifications row Connect and Disconnect, each with a refusal as its control; the Dev Tools row reads Install mise withheld while mise is present and its refusal, and its absent case is the install action `settings.sh` presses on the fixture.
