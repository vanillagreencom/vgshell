# D021: A theme apply writes beside each destination and the shell document last

[← Decision Index](INDEX.md)

**Status**: Active (application-directory writes → [D022](D022-theme-apply-keeps-managed-links-in-application-directories.md))

**Research**: VGS-461

**Context**: An apply now lands one file per enabled application target and keeps one include line in each application's own configuration file. Those files live in a dotfile manager's tree as often as not, reached through a symlink, and one target that cannot render must not cost the others or the shell.

**Decision**: Every write is staged beside its destination and moved in by rename. Every enabled target renders in memory first. Its files join `theme.json` and `terminal.json` in `next-theme/`, the sibling of `theme/`, so the swap is one rename on one filesystem. After the swap and `theme.name`, the include line is kept in each landed target's configuration file. A symlink is resolved, and the file it names is replaced through a temporary file beside it, with its mode kept. The shell document is written last. Nothing else in an application's directory is written, but for the managed links [D022](D022-theme-apply-keeps-managed-links-in-application-directories.md) adds. A target that fails to render reports `failed`, and the apply is then `partial` and exits 3.

No include line is left naming a file the swap drops. A target disabled after it landed has its include line removed the same way the line is kept, and its files leave `theme/`; a removal that cannot be made fails the target and keeps its files. Every other target that renders nothing, failed or skipped, carries the files it landed before into the stage, so its application keeps its last theme.

**Rationale**:

- A rename within one directory is atomic and never crosses a filesystem, so no reader sees half a file. `vgshell plugin add` stages beside its destination for the same reason.
- Replacing the resolved file keeps a dotfile manager's link a link. Replacing the link itself would sever the managed file.
- A stable include path means a later apply changes nothing in the application's directory. The line is asserted on every apply, so a hand edit that drops it is repaired.
- The shell restyles only after every application file and include line is in place, so the displayed theme never runs ahead of the applications.
- Dropping a target's file while its include line stands would leave the application reading a missing include. Carrying the last file keeps the application on its last theme; removing the line is the one way to turn a target off.
- An in-place `write(2)` would keep the inode, but a crash could leave the user's configuration half-written. The rename trades the inode for atomicity.

**Revisit When**: An application reads its configuration through a hard link or watches its inode, or a target needs its include line somewhere other than the file's first line.

**Verification**: `scripts/test-vgshell.sh` covers the partial result, the symlinked edit with a control that replaces the link, the wiring on unchanged bytes with a written-only control, the carried file with a no-carry control and the removed line with a line-keeping control. `scripts/smoke/rows/themes.sh` covers a real partial apply through the `theme` capability.
