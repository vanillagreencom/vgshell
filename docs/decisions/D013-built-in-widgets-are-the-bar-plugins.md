# D013: A built-in widget is part of the plugin that draws it, never a kind

[← Decision Index](INDEX.md)

**Date**: 2026-09-25

**Status**: Active (manager built-in → D032)

**Research**: —

**Context**: The shipped bar draws its own workspaces, clock and manager button inside its section containers, ahead of the plugin widgets the core mounts. The build records list everything on a surface, so those items had to appear there. The first implementation recorded them under a `kind` value of its own, which put a word outside `PluginLogic.KINDS` in the one field every host and script switches on.

**Decision**: A built-in widget is a category of the plugin that draws it. The plugin registers each one through its `builtins` capability as `shell.builtins.register(name, item)`. The core records it under the plugin's host key as `<plugin id>/<name>` with origin `plugin` and the registering instance's kind, so `kind` is only ever a member of `PluginLogic.KINDS`; an instance the core built carries origin `core`. The core builds none of it and the build counter does not move. The shipped bar chooses its built-ins from its own `left`, `center` and `right` settings.

**Rationale**:

- A bar owns the geometry of its sections; what it draws inside them is its own, and needs no manifest, no host and no enablement rule.
- One field with one closed value set keeps every switch on `kind` exhaustive; provenance is a second field, not a second kind.
- Registration keeps the build records complete, so the validation rows read every item on a surface from one place.

**Revisit When**: A second plugin needs to draw items inside another plugin's surface, or a built-in needs its own settings schema or enablement.

**Verification**: The `expect_builtins` rows in `scripts/smoke/rows/bar.sh` and `scripts/smoke/rows/manager.sh` read the registered built-ins, the workspaces and the clock, back from the build records by origin; `scripts/smoke/rows/manager.sh` also holds that a user row still naming the retired manager built-in draws nothing and is logged. The manager built-in's move to the Settings plugin is [D032](D032-settings-plugin-and-manifest-settings-convention.md).
