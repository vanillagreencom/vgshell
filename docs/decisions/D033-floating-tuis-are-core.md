# D033: Floating TUIs are a core concept

[← Decision Index](INDEX.md)

**Date**: 2026-09-28

**Status**: Active (tui/ copy → [D042](D042-tui-scripts-run-from-a-copy-of-the-whole-snapshot.md); run ends → [D043](D043-tui-run-ends-by-lock-release.md))

**Research**: [platform roadmap, attached to VGS-511](https://linear.app/vanillagreen/issue/VGS-511) § 1

**Context**: VGS had no terminal window of its own. `vgshell plugin update` and `vgshell theme update` refuse `no-terminal` from the GUI, because the diff review is a question someone must answer. Updates, package installs, a passwordless sudo grant and plugin requirements all need a place where the user sees a password prompt or a `[y/N]` and answers it, and the shell process must never be that place. Omarchy solves this with one launcher script, `omarchy-launch-floating-terminal-with-presentation`, an app-id its window rule floats, and two helpers, `omarchy-show-logo` and `omarchy-show-done` (basecamp/omarchy `e332dc97`).

**Decision**: A floating TUI is a core concept. `bin/vgshell-tui` is the only file that knows terminals: `launch` opens the user's default terminal through `xdg-terminal-exec` with an app-id from one family, `org.vgs.tui`, `org.vgs.tui.wide` or `org.vgs.tui.tall`, and `present` runs one command inside it as an argv list under the VGS presentation: the logo in the theme accent, the command, then `● Done!` or `● Failed (exit code N)!` on `/dev/tty` and one key, skipped on 130. `bin/lib/tui.sh` is the one presentation library TUI scripts source. Colours come from a `gum.env` file that `present` parses at every run and never sources. A plugin's script runs from a private copy of its snapshot's `tui/` directory. `vgshell tui present` is the core's own entry. The window rule for the app-id family is one constant core section of the Hyprland layer, written from `HyprlandLayer.TUI_WINDOWS`, the same table `launch` reads each class's app-id from; the `tui` manifest key and capability open only a plugin's declared scripts, from its published snapshot, with an argv list. The capability's contract: `shell.tui.run(name, args)` opens one of the caller's own scripts while it is enabled, with at most 16 printable arguments; `shell.tui.entries` lists every TUI with an `entry`, the core's `core/<name>` and every enabled plugin's `<plugin id>/<name>`; `shell.tui.open(key)` opens a listed key with no arguments, as the IPC function `openTui` and `vgshell tui open` do. `run` answers `ok` once the launcher starts, or `refused: tui=<name> reason=undeclared|disabled|args|busy|launcher-missing` at once. `open` answers `ok` once the launcher starts and for a live key whose window it focuses, as Omarchy's `omarchy-launch-or-focus` does, or a refusal for any other case; `PluginLogic.js` makes each decision. The presenter writes an exit record for each run the core launches, a running file before the command and an ended file with its code after it, each written once under a new name, and holds a lock on the key while it lives; the core lists the record directory once, calls a run's `done` once from its ended record, drops a destroyed instance's `done`, publishes `shell.tui.state` to every instance of the plugin, and `run` answers `busy` for a live key while the runner focuses that run's window. `vgshell-tui reap` ends the record of a presenter that died without writing one. The core holds the launcher state: `bin/vgshell-tui check`, which uses the terminal test `launch` uses, answers it when the shell starts, and each probe or launch exit moves it. While the terminal is missing, a request answers `launcher-missing` and starts one probe, so a terminal installed later is found without a restart. `launch` forks the terminal off with `setsid -f` and returns, so a shell restart never kills a terminal, and a launch that finds no terminal after answering `ok` is logged and moves the state. [tui.md](../architecture/tui.md) holds the contract.

**Rationale**:

- The core needs it before any plugin does: plugin and theme update, the package layer and the requirement install run core commands that ask questions.
- It touches three core systems: the Hyprland layer ([D028](D028-one-generated-hyprland-layer.md): no plugin writes Hyprland text), the theme targets and the capability set. A plugin cannot own any of them.
- An argv list never becomes shell code, so a title, an argument or a plugin's manifest text cannot run as a command.
- A declared script from the published snapshot keeps [D014](D014-source-revisions-are-published-snapshots.md)'s "the reviewed revision runs" and [D007](D007-install-runs-no-plugin-code.md)'s review step.
- One size class per app-id lets a caller pick a window size without writing geometry, so no plugin text reaches a window rule.

## Where VGS differs from Omarchy

| Omarchy | VGS | Why |
|---|---|---|
| The launcher hands the command to `bash -c "$*"`. | `present` runs argv as a list. | Text from a plugin or a caller never becomes shell code. |
| `omarchy-launch-or-focus` runs `eval exec setsid $LAUNCH_COMMAND`, and the menu runs `bash -lc <string>`. | No `eval`, no shell string at any step. | The same reason. |
| Menu entries are JSONC `action` strings with bash `when` conditions, and `omarchy-launch-tui` execs `setsid`. | A plugin's TUIs are judged manifest data, opened by name or key, and `launch` forks with `setsid -f`. | A launcher lists any plugin's TUIs without code, and the shell tracks the launcher it starts, so the terminal must not be that process. |
| The launcher runs under `uwsm-app`. | `setsid` alone. | VGS has no uwsm dependency. |
| `omarchy-default-terminal` rewrites the user's `xdg-terminals.list`. | VGS reads the user's default and never writes it. | VGS does not own the terminal choice. |
| Gum colours reach the session through login-time `hl.env` lines, and the launcher re-exports them from the generated file each time. | `present` parses `gum.env` from the theme state directory at every run. | A file read at each run follows every apply, with no environment that goes stale after a theme switch. |
| The colour file is parsed with awk and each pair exported. | Every line must match one rule, or none is used. | A file that runs code is refused whole, not in part. |
| The logo is ANSI green. | The logo is the theme accent. | The accent is the VGS colour, and it follows the theme. |
| One app-id, `org.omarchy.terminal`, tagged `floating-window` at 875×600. | Three app-ids, one per size class, each matched exactly. | A long update log or a package picker needs more room than a confirm; the class names the size. |
| Step lines are inline escapes in each script. | Library functions. | One place for each line's look. |
| The sudo keepalive is a separate executable. | A library function tied to the script's pid and ended on exit, hang-up and termination. | The credential leaves with the script that asked for it. |
| Scripts run from the Omarchy checkout. | A plugin's script runs from a private copy of its snapshot's `tui/`. | A restart removes old snapshots while the script may still source a file beside it. |
| `omarchy-update` ends with `omarchy-update-status`, which tells the shell's update indicator over IPC to refresh. | The presenter writes an exit record, and the core calls the caller's `done` and moves `shell.tui.state` from it. | No script needs to know who opened it, and one record serves every caller of the key. |
| Omarchy's floating launcher opens a new terminal on every call. | A request for a live key focuses its window. `run` answers `busy` for callers that need a `done`; `open` answers `ok` for callers that only need the TUI shown. | A double click never stacks two update windows. |

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Why rejected |
|---|---|
| Omarchy's string launcher: `vgshell-launch-floating "<cmd>"` into `bash -c` | Plugin text becomes shell code, every plugin invents its own script location, colours and ending, and nothing ties a launch to the plugin's manifest. |
| A TUI drawn in QML: a panel with a log view and native dialogs | It re-implements a pty, gum's widgets, fzf and sudo's password prompt. Package managers, AUR helpers and `passwd` expect a real terminal. |
| Plugin-authored window rules as manifest data | It reopens D028's plugin data scope for a need three size classes already meet, and puts more judged text into Lua. |
| A `vgs.system` plugin holding update, install and sudo flows | The core itself uses those flows: the requirement install needs the package layer, and plugin update needs the terminal. A plugin would be a second owner of package flows and a core feature behind a plugin toggle. |

**Revisit When**: xdg-terminal-exec drops `--app-id`, or the owner's default terminal stops honouring it; gum changes its environment variable names or how it reads the terminal; a TUI needs a geometry no size class covers.

**Verification**: `scripts/test-tui-logic.js` pins each refusal of the `tui` key and of a request by its text, with a control per rule, the shared shown answer for a busy key, the order of the refusals and the launcher state's moves among them, and the judge of an exit record, the runs, the state, each `done` answer and a run's window; `bin/lib/check-manifests.js` refuses a script that is a link, not a regular file or not executable, pinned by `scripts/test-check-manifests.js`; `scripts/smoke/rows/tui.sh` reads the argv a stand-in xdg-terminal-exec records in the nested sandbox, each refusal, the logged `launcher-missing` line, the synchronous `launcher-missing` answer through the capability, `openTui` and `vgshell tui open`, the probe that finds the terminal again, a run's `done` and state, a busy answer that focuses the run's window, a destroyed instance's dropped `done`, a presenter copy that writes no ended record and the `wait` that ends its run ([D043](D043-tui-run-ends-by-lock-release.md)), and a disabled plugin's list. `scripts/smoke/rows/launcher.sh` and `scripts/smoke/rows/manager.sh` hold a core TUI live and prove that the launcher and the manager both treat the focused busy key as shown. `scripts/test-vgshell-tui.sh` also pins the records, the key's lock and reap, and runs `present` on a pseudo-terminal against stub commands exiting 0, 1 and 130, and `launch` and `vgshell tui present` against a stub `xdg-terminal-exec`, with controls that source `gum.env`, prompt on stdout, run argv through `bash -c`, point `VGS_PLUGIN_DIR` at the snapshot, drop a size and exec `setsid` without `-f`, and pins `vgshell tui list` and `vgshell tui open` against a stub `qs`. `scripts/test-tui.sh` covers the library with stand-ins for gum, sudo, uname and pgrep.
