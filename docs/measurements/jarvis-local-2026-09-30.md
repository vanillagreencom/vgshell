# Local speech measurements

Instrument: `shell/plugins/vgs.jarvis/measure-local`. Original run: J38, 2026-09-30, from `09:45:56.664616Z` to `09:51:12.882332Z`. [The original successful-run log](jarvis-local-2026-09-30.txt) is unchanged. It contains incomplete multilingual readings and incorrect standalone synthesis ratios, explicitly superseded below. [The supplemental log](jarvis-local-2026-09-30-fix.txt) holds the corrected resident runs, reproducible Moonshine failure and arithmetic corrections.

## Inputs and machine

- Host: `cachy`, AMD Ryzen 9 9950X, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, driver `615.71.09`.
- Backend: sherpa-onnx `1.13.8+cuda13.cudnn9.onnxruntime1.28.2`. CPU rows use its CPU execution provider, not CUDA. The native CPU-only wheel is not measured here.
- smart-turn: ONNX Runtime `1.30.0`, Transformers `5.17.0`. NumPy: `2.5.3`. The feature extractor needs no PyTorch model.
- Input: the pinned synthetic clip and paired text in [artifacts.json](../../shell/plugins/vgs.jarvis/artifacts.json). The short clip contains `43281` mono PCM samples at `16000` Hz, or `2.7050625` seconds.
- Long inputs repeat complete clips. Leading silence fills the remaining samples to the requested length. No last utterance is cut. The text-to-speech input stays the paired original sentence.
- Every child runs in a scrubbed environment under `unshare -rn`. No microphone, playback tool, account or live desktop endpoint participates. Downloads and dependency preparation occur separately.
- Model calls use `2` inference threads. Cold load means fresh model objects with backend-specific first imports. It does not mean an evicted filesystem cache.
- Peak RAM is the process's lifetime `ru_maxrss`, including imports, integrity checks and all resident models. GPU peak is sampled compute allocation for this process. The sampler waits `0.05` seconds between queries; query time adds to the interval. Its reading is a sampled lower bound, not an exact maximum.
- Unload measures model-object destruction and garbage collection. It does not measure process exit. The CUDA contexts still hold `627048448` bytes after large-tier unload and `662700032` bytes after multilingual-CUDA unload. J39 must not equate object destruction with complete process-memory release.

Measured source SHA-256:

| Input | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| `artifacts.json` | `358ab59c36f7a9f3293af0afa4159bbf37389e6ab40cfdaf6660d67630470881` |
| `measure-local` | `0d3c38980a38b56a13bc8f04396f7549128531babe98f0c27525ac6564806b7c` |
| Raw log | `271c13f81772bfaf2174bdfaf93fd3e04ff47b362262eb9de011a4149d37de94` |

These bindings remain the source of reused standalone, small/medium/large and caption readings. The supplemental run uses artifact declaration `bce9c45d9d3e9647076f374f087957e3e9c9080b2863d4bbdab43d3678dad396` and instrument `555d232ddacedfc2d7993bae71b9dbdbba1d563f1c7ce8038c60d55f68ba0cf0`. Guard, provider and error-precedence changes do not replace successful old timing observations with new inference.

## Bundled-clip execution

All rows below exited `0`. These are execution readings, not language accuracy or voice-quality scores.

| Artifact | Cold load s | First turn s | Warm turn s | Unload s | Peak RAM MiB | Warm real-time factor |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Parakeet | 0.796 | 0.103 | 0.097 | 0.032 | 1073.46 | 0.0357 |
| Moonshine | 0.275 | 0.033 | 0.031 | 0.014 | 410.86 | 0.0115 |
| Whisper turbo | 0.717 | 1.047 | 1.015 | 0.036 | 1613.00 | 0.3753 |
| Kokoro | 0.521 | 0.632 | 0.630 | 0.041 | 601.42 | 0.2057 |
| Piper | 0.502 | 0.064 | 0.063 | 0.015 | 229.98 | 0.0239 |
| Silero | 0.020 | 0.010 | 0.006 | 0.005 | 78.55 | 0.0022 |
| smart-turn | 0.452 | 0.045 | 0.053 | 0.048 | 226.66 | 0.0196 |
| Wake model | 0.399 | 0.083 | 0.048 | 0.012 | 93.73 | 0.0179 |
| Nemotron | 0.881 | 0.423 | 0.399 | 0.035 | 1397.90 | 0.1477 |

`measure-local::outcome` checks the fixture's known transcript words, generated audio rate and duration, speech sample count and complete-turn probability. The wake row requires actual streaming decode calls. It permits no keyword hit. This clip produced none. J59 owns room accuracy and reliable wake activation.

The corrected synthesis ratios use the original warm results, not new inference. Kokoro: `0.6296242729877122 / 3.0605416666666665 = 0.20572315020087803`. Piper: `0.06251812202390283 / 2.6122448979591835 = 0.023932718587275307`. The raw original ratios `0.23275775439115073` and `0.023111525897794537` divided by recognition input duration and are superseded.

## Resident tiers

Each row keeps the tier's entire selected set resident, including CPU Nemotron captions. The manifest owns tier membership and per-artifact providers. The input is `60` seconds. This is total sequential compute, not end-of-speech latency. Streaming caption compute normally happens while audio arrives.

| Tier | Cold load s | First turn s | Warm turn s | Unload s | Peak RAM MiB | Sampled peak GPU MiB | Warm real-time factor |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| small | 2.249 | 8.219 | 8.123 | 0.063 | 1813.71 | not used | 0.1354 |
| medium | 2.981 | 10.314 | 10.971 | 0.186 | 3303.58 | not used | 0.1829 |
| large | 3.589 | 9.526 | 9.324 | 0.152 | 3782.72 | 4004.00 | 0.1554 |
| multilingual CPU | 3.278 | 18.171 | 17.682 | 0.130 | 5506.39 | not used | 0.2947 |
| multilingual CUDA | 3.704 | 13.176 | 12.900 | 0.132 | 4801.34 | 6484.00 | 0.2150 |

These observations are not admission ceilings or guarantees for other machines, languages or voices. J41 owns live free-memory checks, reserves, fallback and limits.

Only the multilingual rows were re-measured, on `cachy` from `12:14:51.112156Z` to `12:16:25.544147Z`, with the complete resident set and unchanged runtime versions. Whisper executes independent `464000`, `464000` and `32000` sample segments on both first and warm turns. The original single-call SDK diagnostic says it processes only the first input window and discards remaining data. Prefix acceptance did not prove complete execution.

Superseded incomplete multilingual observations, retained for comparison:

| Tier | Cold load s | First turn s | Warm turn s | Unload s | Peak RAM MiB | Sampled peak GPU MiB | Input ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| multilingual CPU | 3.806 | 14.009 | 14.330 | 0.232 | 5450.77 | not used | 0.2388 |
| multilingual CUDA | 4.426 | 11.499 | 11.317 | 0.152 | 4694.81 | 5976.00 | 0.1886 |

## Caption cost

Parakeet rows decode the complete buffer once per turn. Nemotron rows decode cached streaming frames. Each row includes a first turn and a warm turn in the raw log.

| Model and provider | Input s | Cold load s | Warm compute s | Unload s | Peak RAM MiB | Sampled peak GPU MiB |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Parakeet CPU | 30 | 0.831 | 0.953 | 0.036 | 1585.71 | not used |
| Parakeet CPU | 60 | 0.882 | 2.367 | 0.038 | 2034.80 | not used |
| Parakeet CUDA | 30 | 1.204 | 0.841 | 0.042 | 2259.08 | 1972.00 |
| Parakeet CUDA | 60 | 1.172 | 1.678 | 0.051 | 2428.04 | 2620.00 |
| Nemotron CPU | 30 | 0.999 | 3.431 | 0.042 | 1379.18 | not used |
| Nemotron CPU | 60 | 0.854 | 6.625 | 0.028 | 1118.84 | not used |

Parakeet's full-buffer cost exceeds the plan's `200` ms caption interval. Nemotron's longest warm decode calls were `0.07389942201552913` seconds at `30` seconds and `0.07672057900344953` seconds at `60` seconds. Its export advances in `560` ms model chunks. It is not a `200` ms streaming model. [D066](../decisions/D066-pinned-local-speech-and-bounded-inputs.md) selects it for captions.

## Moonshine bound

The unbounded `60`-second probe failed with an ONNX attention broadcast error, `7 by 2498`, and an empty transcript. Independent chunks of at most `80000` samples close the execution blocker. [The input contract](../architecture/jarvis-local.md#moonshine-input-contract) states what J39 must implement.

The supplemental test-only probe reproduces that native error on `2026-09-30T12:14:25.729972629Z` and exits `1`. Its command, stderr, runtime versions and source bindings are preserved separately. Probe SHA-256: `8a1dcb68b6c4db213963533caf9043dd97d830a980b58c518961150f4c0e3070`. It does not add an unbounded production CLI.

The cache-free probe follow-up reproduces the same error on `2026-09-30T12:53:45.866191927Z`, exits `1`, and uses probe SHA-256 `9555ce530ad620431c40e0793d9108465c0db88e9f6a17cbcb3e274f7248b71f`. It disables bytecode output when importing the instrument, so the runtime source tree remains unchanged. No resident tier was re-measured for this probe-only change.

- The `30`-second standalone probe decoded `6` chunks. Cold load: `0.296` seconds. Warm compute: `0.395` seconds. Unload: `0.014` seconds. Peak RAM: `410.44` MiB.
- The `60`-second small-tier probe decoded `12` chunks of `80000` samples. It consumed all `960000` samples.
- No test establishes word-boundary reconstruction or semantic transcription quality across those boundaries.
