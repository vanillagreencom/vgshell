"""Enforce the pointer rules docs/architecture/components.md states.

Every element of shipped QML that takes a click shows the pointing hand
through `PointerCursor` from qs.Ui, the one owner of the hand, and no view
scrolls by a mouse drag:
  cursor-missing   an element that takes a click declares no PointerCursor
                   among its direct children. A TapHandler holds no
                   children, so it takes one among its parent's. The
                   elements that take a click are a MouseArea, unless it
                   sets `acceptedButtons: Qt.NoButton`, a TapHandler, and a
                   control extending one of TEMPLATE_CONTROLS, named through
                   the alias an `import QtQuick.Templates as <alias>` line
                   binds. A HoverHandler takes no click. The line
                   `// pointer-cursor-exempt: <reason>` in the comment block
                   directly above the element exempts it; a marker with no
                   reason exempts nothing.
  cursor-literal   `Qt.PointingHandCursor` in any file but the
                   repository's own shell/Ui/foundation/PointerCursor.qml,
                   matched by resolved path, so a file of that name under
                   any other tree, a plugin's included, is no owner.
  mouse-drag       an element of DRAG_VIEWS, Flickable and the views built
                   on it, that does not set `acceptedButtons: Qt.NoButton`
                   among its own properties, so a mouse press and drag
                   scrolls it. ScrollArea in qs.Ui sets it once for every
                   use. No marker exempts it.
The rules read code with comments blanked, through scripts/qml_source.py;
the structure is read with string contents blanked too, so a brace inside a
string opens no block.

Usage: check-pointer-cursor.py [DIR...]
With no directory, the repository's shell/ and the vgs-plugin skill
templates, which a plugin author copies. `vgs-plugin check` passes one
plugin directory.

Every finding is one line: `<rule> <file>:<line> <detail>`. The pass is
`check-pointer-cursor: ok files=<n> clickable=<n> exempt=<n> views=<n>`,
`views` counting the elements of DRAG_VIEWS read. Exit 0 when clean, 1 on
any finding, 2 when a directory or file cannot be read, printed as
`check-pointer-cursor: unreadable: <path>: <strerror>`. A tree the walk
found no QML file in is unreadable too: an empty walk certifies nothing.
