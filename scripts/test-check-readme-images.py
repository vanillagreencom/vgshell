"""The controls of check-readme-images.py: one planted defect per rule on a
passing scratch tree, each turning the check red with exactly its own
finding, the discovery floor, the --table mode and the argument refusal.

Each case copies the check into a fresh scratch tree, seeds the passing
world below, applies its defect and runs the copy, whose root is the tree
it sits in. The world holds two plugins whose ids share a prefix, vgs.one
and vgs.one-two, so an image named for vgs.one-two belongs to it alone; a
README with a fenced block and a code span naming a remote image, which is
no image; and an HTML <img>, which is one. The walk's floor is the case
with no manifest; both seeded plugins are required members, since the
passing world fails when either README goes unread, and a directory with
no manifest is the forbidden one."""
