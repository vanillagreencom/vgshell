# mode some scale divides is kept whole: a hold at the window's own mode
# survives a host configure of the same size. The host window rule sizes
# the nested window, and it can leave no divisor, as 1756x933 does (933 is
# 3 x 311, 1756 is 4 x 439); the trimmed mode differs from the window by
# fewer than S pixels per side, so a host configure resets it and

# held_mode_state: what became of the held mode, as one word. `held`: the
# output reads its mode and scale. `reset`: the output reads another mode
# or another scale. Once the hold began, the host moves a nested output
# off it, and that is not what a held row measures. Aquamarine's Wayland
# backend turns every xdg_toplevel configure the host sends the nested
# window into a state event with the configure's size
# (CWaylandOutput::CWaylandOutput in src/backend/Wayland.cpp, aquamarine
# v0.15.1), and the host sends one whenever it resizes the window or
# changes its state, focus and tiling included. For a Wayland-backend
# output, Hyprland's state listener applies the active rule again with
# that size in place of the rule's mode, unless the two are equal
# (CMonitor::onConnect in src/output/Monitor.cpp, Hyprland v0.56.2). The
# rule keeps its scale, and CMonitor::applyMonitorRule moves a scale that
# leaves fractional logical pixels to the nearest one that does not: a
# 1755x933 window under a 3510x1866 hold at scale 2 reads 1755x933 at
# scale 1.5. A hold at the window's own size survives a configure of the
# same size and no resize. Each applied rule, the host's size included,
# becomes the active rule (CMonitor::applyMonitorRuleSoft, same file), so
# after a resize away a configure back to the window's own size differs
# from the active rule and gives the output that size again: a scale-1
# hold at the window's own size comes back without its rule, and a
# reading after both configures reads `held`. No host configure equals a
# doubled mode, so a scale-2 hold comes back only through its rule
# applied again (hold_restore), or a configuration reload, which the
# shell runs when its Hyprland layer changes: a reload drops every rule
# `hyprctl eval` added (src/config/lua/ConfigManager.cpp,
# CConfigManager::reload, v0.56.2) and applies the rule mode_hold_file
# names again. The shell writes no monitor rule of its own.
