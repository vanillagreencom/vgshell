# No row authenticates against the host user. The nested sandbox shares the
# host's PAM, polkit and faillock, so a sudo, a polkit authentication, a
# keyring unlock or a failed password a row caused would count against the
# owner's own account. harness.sh stands a sentinel for every command that
# asks for one in the PATH directory every sandbox shell starts with, and
# replaces the sandbox tree's bin/vgshell-browser-policy, which runs sudo from
# the system directories alone, with one more. This row, the last, reads
# that each sentinel resolves first on that PATH, or a stub a row stood
# over it that never authenticates, that the tree's writer is still the
# sentinel, and that no sentinel was called during the run. Its control:
# a call through a sentinel after that reading is logged, so an empty log
# is a run that called none, not a sentinel that logs nothing.
# inputs: bin/* shell/* scripts/smoke/fixtures/*
