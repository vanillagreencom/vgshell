# Bringing a window into view: the compositor capability's `reveal`
# (shell/Core/Compositor.qml, shell/Core/Dispatch.js), driven through the
# fixture's `reveal` handle on windows of the toplevel helper: one on
# another workspace, the one focused last seen from an empty workspace,
# one in a hidden special workspace, one under another window's
# fullscreen, one in a background group tab, one on a second monitor, one
# of several windows of one application, and an application that raises
# its own window while the reveal waits for it. Each case starts from the
# other window focused on workspace 1, or from the empty workspace, and
# first reads its target out of view, so `in view` cannot pass on the
# state before the reveal. Hyprland v0.56.2's focus dispatcher already
# shows the workspace, the special workspace, the group tab and the
# monitor of the window it focuses, and ends a fullscreen over it, so the
# old path, that
# dispatcher alone on the first window of the application, fails only
# where the reveal decides something: whether the window already shows,
# which of several windows, and whether to move at all when the
# application moved first. Those three cases carry the old path or the old
# rule as their control. The row ends with its windows closed, its monitor
# removed and workspace 1 focused.
