# Start order, D047. The row stops any running shell and starts the
# sandbox's tree again over the default set, every first-party plugin
# enabled as in a live session (harness.sh's default_set_prepare), plus
# two fixtures that name the lock: acme.contention, a background, and
# acme.locker, a service. The compiled QML cache is cleared first, so the
# start compiles as the first start of the run did. It reads:
# - the first bar within the default set's budget, printed as
#   latency_first_bar_ms with plugin_set=default;
# - ServiceGate's release, reason first-frame, and in the probe's start
#   order every bar window's first frame before the first service the core
#   built;
# - the lock held by the background and the service not built: at start
#   every surface plugin claims before any service;
# - the theme follow of the start's scan queued in the turn that scan
#   ended, so it never waits on the service gate, which releases on a bar
#   frame in a later turn, and one more follow for a rescan.
# Three controls start the same state over a mutant copy of the tree, each
# holding its own bin/ and shell/ with config/ and themes/ linked, as
# rows/notices-control.sh does: a service host with no gate builds its
# services in the scan's turn, before the first frame; a background host
# that waits for a built service leaves the lock with the service; a
# follow moved onto the gate's release is queued after its scan's turn; a
# follow that runs only while the services are held queues none for a
# rescan. Before the restart with no bar, the row reads the instance
# lock, D053, with a planted process that outlives the shell and stands in
# for a download: the shell holds no descriptor on the lock; `vgshell
# restart` during that process brings a guarded shell back; after a
# SIGKILL to the shell the same runner starts a new shell, D069, and
# holds the lock while the planted process holds none; and harness.sh's
# stop_shell returns with a relaunched runner's lock free.
# Its controls are a copy of the tree whose runner execs qs with the
# lock's descriptor open, whose restart refuses stop=timeout and after
# whose crash the planted process holds the lock and `vgshell run` exits 75;
# a stop with no
# lock wait, which returns with the lock held while the shell is stopped
# with SIGSTOP; and a stop that times out on the lock, which fails and
# names the runner among its holders. The row restores the incoming
# plugin set and stand-ins before starting the sandbox's own tree again.
# Otherwise the default set's VPN readers can add subprocess calls while
# a later row checks that its widget actions start none.
