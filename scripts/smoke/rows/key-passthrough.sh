# Key capture pass-through, D086, after rows/key-capture.sh, whose shell
# and Settings plugin it keeps. Every way a capture ends leaves the nested
# Hyprland's vgs:passthrough submap, read through `hyprctl submap` of the
# nested instance alone: a commit, Escape (the submap's own bind), a focus
# loss to a toplevel helper that maps over the window, the window's close,
# a `hyprctl reload` of the nested instance, the 10 s timeout (still held
# at 5 s, gone by 14 s, polled every 200 ms, and named on the field) and a
# SIGKILL of the shell, whose window then closes. Each path has a control:
# a tree copy with that exit removed holds the submap a second after the
# same exit, and the row resets it by hand. The commit control drops the
# owner's leave on commit, the Escape control binds Escape to a no-op, the
# focus control drops the field's focus-loss cancel, the close control
# drops every leave but commit and cancel and the layer's window close
# hook, the reload control drops the layer's leave as it loads, the timeout
# control drops the timer's leave, and the SIGKILL control drops the close
# hook. The row appends `input:resolve_binds_by_sym` to the nested
# hyprland.lua, so wtype's Escape reaches the submap's bind, and puts the
# file back at its end. Keys go to the nested seat alone.
