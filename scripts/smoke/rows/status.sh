# Plugin status, D037. The fixture's service publishes typed values through
# its `status` capability, and every instance of the plugin reads the one
# record the core holds for the plugin: the service, a bar widget on each of
# two screens and a summoned panel read back one revision and one set of
# values. A key the manifest does not declare, a value of the wrong type and
# values past the ceiling are refused by their keyed line and change
# nothing, and the published values do not change in place. Disabling the
# plugin drops its record from the lending record, a write through a
# provider the core retired does not bring it back, and the rebuilt service
# publishes again from nothing; a new source revision drops the record too.
# The row ends with the fixture disabled and its screen removed, so the
# later rows' bars and lending records hold nothing of it. rows/settings.sh
# enables it again to read its Status rows.
# inputs: scripts/smoke/fixtures/plugins/acme.status/* shell/Core/PluginStatus.qml shell/Core/PluginLogic.js scripts/smoke/fixtures/plugins/acme.probe/* scripts/smoke/rows/plugins.sh
