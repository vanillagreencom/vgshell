# Settings edits and the dispatch queue. The Settings window opens from a
# real click on the gear, so the compositor gives its window the keyboard,
# and a click on a text field gives that field keyboard focus. A write is
# published once: its own file notification is read and found identical.
# An unrelated change keeps an edit in progress: the same drawn field, its
# focus, its text and its cursor. The plugin is disabled again at the end,
# so the later rows' lending records hold no Settings shortcut or IPC
# target. A mouse drag leaves a page where it was, while a wheel notch and
# Tab scroll it, and a two-finger swipe moves it as far as GTK moves a list. Dispatches asked for back to back run in order behind one
# process, the queue has a bound, and a process that cannot start does not
# stop the queue.
