# Supervision, D069: the runner starts the shell again after it dies, and
# gives up with a Hyprland notice after a streak of quick deaths. The row
# reads, in the nested sandbox:
# - SIGKILL to the shell's qs: the same runner starts a new shell, which
#   answers as the guarded instance, and the bar maps again. The time from
#   the kill to the new shell answering ping is printed as
#   latency_relaunch_ms and held under relaunch_budget_ms, below.
# - a crash loop from a fresh runner: each new shell killed as soon as the
#   lock file names it. After five relaunches the runner gives up: it exits
#   with the killed shell's status, 137, its log holds its gave-up line,
#   and it asked Hyprland for one error notice, which Hyprland answered ok.
#   The runner resolves hyprctl through the shell's stand-in directory, the
#   first entry of its PATH, where a stand-in logs each notify call and
#   Hyprland's reply and execs the real hyprctl for every call.
# Controls start copies of the tree: a runner that reads Hyprland as gone
# after every exit brings no shell back within the budget; a runner whose
# give-up limit is out of reach still runs after the same six kills. The
# row ends with a fresh shell of the tree for the rows after it, and the
# real hyprctl in the stand-in directory.
# inputs: bin/vgshell
set -euo pipefail

# The ceiling on latency_relaunch_ms, the time from the SIGKILL to the new
# shell answering ping, read through harness.sh's adopt_shell, which polls
# the lock file every 50 ms and ping every 200 ms, so the reading carries
# at most 250 ms of polling. It holds the runner's first delay, 0.5 s.
# Twice the highest of six readings of this row on host cachy on
# 2026-09-30, at load average 5 to 8: 733 to 757 ms.
