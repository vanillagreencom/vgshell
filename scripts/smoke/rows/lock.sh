# The lock, vgs.lock: a first-party service on the core's `lock`
# capability. The harness starts it disabled; this row enables it and locks
# the nested session through each entry point: its IPC function, `vgshell
# lock`, SUPER+DELETE on the nested seat, its idle watch and its before-sleep
# hook. Each lock is read back from the compositor, a monitor naming LOCK
# among the reasons it cannot go solitary in `hyprctl -j monitors`, and
# from the core's lending record. The lock screen's geometry holds the
# design standard on every screen (docs/architecture/design-quality.md):
# each part inside its surface, the time and the date at least `stack.row`
# apart, the field and the status line each at least `stack.group` below
# the block above, the field at least `size.control.md` tall and centred;
# its control is a planted reading with the field `stack.group` short.
# While a second lock client, the harness's
# lock-client standing in for another locker, holds the session, the
# plugin's lock takes over under the restore option; the client's unlock
# then unlocks the session, the core ends the plugin's lock, and the plugin
# publishes it and locks again. A sleep whose budget runs out before the
# lock is confirmed is published and shown as a toast once unlocked.
# A hook that cannot start is published as such and taken again once the
# setting turns it back on. Disabling the plugin while locked keeps
# the session locked, and the rebuilt plugin hands its lock screen over
# again. The shell killed by its pid while locked leaves the session
# locked, the runner starts the next shell (D069), and that shell's lock
# plugin reads the stranded lock and takes it over through the layer's
# `misc.allow_session_lock_restore`. A sampler reads the session lock from
# the compositor every 100 ms from before the kill until the new shell's
# lock is confirmed and must find it locked each time; its control runs it
# across the second lock client's unlock, which unlocks the session. An
# unlock shorter than one 100 ms sample, between two readings, is not
# read. The runner's relaunch line for each kill names session=locked,
# the runner's own reading of the same lock. The time from the kill to the
# confirmed lock with the lock screen is printed as latency_lock_back_ms
# and held under lock_back_budget_ms, below.
#
# No row types a password: PAM would check it against the real account,
# whose pam_faillock counts each failure. The sandbox's own probe releases
# the core's lock with no password, test code that never ships
# (docs/decisions/D062-native-lock-and-polkit-plugins.md). The evidence that no
# check ran spans the whole row, every plugin rebuild and both shell
# relaunches: each shell's log, kept before its kill, holds a
# `lock: check=started` line for every check started, and the harness's
# watcher records every authentication helper it sees under the sandbox.
# A control copy of the plugin starts one stand-in check, which runs no
# PAM, before the restarts, and a stand-in named unix_chkpwd, a copy of
# sleep, runs early too: at the row's end the whole-row readings must hold
# exactly those two, so a reading of the last instance or the last shell
# alone would fail.
#
# The before-sleep hook runs under stand-ins in the shell's stand-in
# directory: a systemd-inhibit that runs its command with no inhibitor and
# logs the command's lines, a busctl that answers logind's 5 s default and
# no preparation under way, and a dbus-monitor that prints the bus's
# NameAcquired at once and announces one PrepareForSleep once the row
# creates its trigger file. The sandbox's system bus holds no logind.
#
# The control installs a copy of the plugin, in the user directory whose id
# wins, that never locks a stranded session: after a kill and a restart the
# session is still locked while the core holds no lock, so the takeover
# reading is not vacuous. `lock` is exclusive, so the row disables the
# capability rows' fixture, acme.probe, when an earlier row left it
# enabled. The row ends with the plugin disabled, the fixture as it found
# it, the stand-ins gone and hyprland.lua as the consent row left it.
