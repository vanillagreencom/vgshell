# HiDPI: a shell started on the first monitor held at double its mode and
# scale 2. It reads:
# - the hold: the compositor reports the first monitor's sized mode,
#   doubled, at scale 2 (hold_mode's poll of `hyprctl -j monitors`);
# - a configuration reload under the hold, after the scale alone dropped
#   to 1: the reload runs the harness's hold file and the held mode and
#   scale come back;
# - the shell's screen, as the host handed it to the vgs.themes background
#   (the probe's screenOf): devicePixelRatio 2 at half the held mode, the
#   monitor's logical size;
# - the background's requested sourceSize: the held mode, in device pixels;
# - the Gallery ImageText sample's pool image and magenta pixels: its
#   sourceSize equals deviceSize, and deviceSize is twice imageSize;
# - the notifications inbox at scale 2, the owner's display scale: a long
#   inbox opened eight times shows its first card whole each time, under
#   the header and inside the list's clip (rows/notifications-keys.sh's
#   long_inbox_cut, whose control holds it at scale 1).
# Controls: the scale alone drops to 1 under the hold, the compositor
# reports that scale and the hold reads it as a reset, so the reading is
# the scale the compositor applied; with the hold file removed, the same
# scale-only drop and reload leave the held mode at scale 1 and the hold
# reads reset, so the file brings the hold back; a sandbox copy of
# Background.qml that decodes at logical pixels requests half the held
# mode; a same-scale shrink gives the background a smaller device size,
# and a reader copy without hold_restore fails the held-size assertion.
# Every background size read restores the hold first, since a host
# configure can reset the output between the inbox and the rescan.
# The Gallery ImageText pixel reader reuses the Gallery row's
# alt-only control at scale 1, so the scale-2 row adds no second control.
# The row starts its own shell because a scale change under a running
# shell does not reach it: the screen reports no devicePixelRatio change,
# and a window that exists keeps drawing at the old ratio
# (docs/architecture/runtime-qml.md). It stops the shell
# rows/notices-control.sh left running, starts the sandbox's tree over the
# default set, every first-party plugin enabled (harness.sh's
# default_set_prepare), stops that shell and gives the monitor its own
# mode at scale 1 again. It leaves no shell running; rows/start-order.sh
# starts its own.
#
# This row adds no latency budget. It starts the shell through
# harness.sh's start_shell, so it reuses the smoke startup poll intervals:
# 10 ms for the first bar and one `vgshell ipc` round trip for readiness.
