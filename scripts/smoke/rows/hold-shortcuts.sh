# Core hold shortcuts on physical keycodes, not global dispatch proxies.
# One persistent virtual keyboard lets a row change configuration while a
# key stays down. The client records actual evdev edges. No latency budget:
# fixture and client readings poll through IPC or the harness's 200 ms log
# reader. The unit runner controls registration, guards and teardown.
