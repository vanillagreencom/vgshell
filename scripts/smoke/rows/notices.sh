# The requirement notice, raised for the fixture acme.needs, which misses
# one command it needs and two optional ones. Runs after rows/tui.sh and
# reuses the stand-in xdg-terminal-exec harness.sh's terminal_stand_in
# wrote, which records the argv the core's TUI launch hands the terminal
# and runs the core's command as `true`, and the harness's helpers. A stand-in bin/vgshell-pkg answers detection with pacman and
# paru, whatever the host runs. The notice is the core's, with the Plugins
# window closed throughout. Rows: `vgshell plugin add` raises the notice
# through pluginInstalled, which maps one surface on the focused monitor
# holding the keyboard and drawing one chip per package with the purposes
# under it, the command's name when no package is known; the surface fills the monitor less the bar's reserved space less
# `dialog.margin`, clears the bar by that margin and centres the dialog; a
# click on the bar's acme.tick widget reaches it while the notice shows; a
# click on the surface beside the dialog reaches the acme.layers fixture's
# layer below, which rows/layers.sh installed and left disabled, and a click
# on the dialog's title does not, which is the mask's control;
# Escape closes it and rests the plugin's own offers;
# enabling the plugin raises it again; the plugin's offer merges into a
# held notice and is refused while it rests, for a command it did not
# declare and for a value that is no list of commands; Install hands the
# terminal `vgshell pkg run install` with the primary's package, the notice
# has no surface while the run is live, and comes back with the keyboard
# when the rescan after the run still misses the command; a scan that finds
# the command while the run is live keeps the installing notice in front of
# a second plugin's waiting one, and the scan after the run closes it and
# brings the waiting one forward; a detection that fails shows the commands
# alone with Close. The enable trigger's control is
# scripts/smoke/rows/notices-control.sh, the suite's last row: a shell copy
# without the trigger raises no notice.
