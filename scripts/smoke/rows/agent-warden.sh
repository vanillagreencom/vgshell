# vgs.agent-warden, D041. The service is the one reader of the warden's
# status file. The row writes vsys's own fixture documents into the
# sandbox's runtime dir, $rt_dir/agent-warden/status.json, each replaced by
# rename as the warden replaces it, with its time and its events' set to
# now, so it is fresh, or ten minutes back, so it is stale. It reads each
# state back through the plugin's `status` IPC function, which answers the
# record the core holds, and reads the plugin's Settings rows back from the
# Settings window. An older warden's state.json alone reads as Update the
# warden, and the empty directory as Not set up. The vsys requirement reads
# missing or present from the scan as a stub on the sandbox PATH comes and
# goes; the host's PATH sets its first answer. The Settings page draws a
# step and its command only while the step applies: none anywhere while the
# warden checks and vsys is present, Set up with its command behind Show
# command while the warden is not set up, and Install all missing while
# vsys is missing. A status written 85 s back and left
# unchanged turns stale on the service's own timer, with no file change.
# The shield in the bar and its panel are read back as drawn for each
# state: the icon, tone, count and tooltip, and every text the panel draws,
# none of which names a scope unit or a process id. Set up and Open vsys
# hand the stand-in terminal their TUI's argv, which runs neither script
# (scripts/test-agent-warden-tui.sh runs them), Start it hands a stand-in
# systemctl its arguments, and, on a host without vsys, Get vsys raises the
# core's notice, which the scan that finds vsys closes. Each open runs the
# stand-in vsys's summary once, and a summary that fails when the open
# panel is summoned again leaves no earlier line.
# A stand-in notify-send records every notice. The service touches the
# warden's heartbeat while a status reads, and again at once when one
# reads after an unreadable one. It sends one notice per episode across
# ticks, and again after the episode clears, as Agent Warden with its
# urgency and Open vsys, sends nothing under notify: off, shows a move as
# a toast under notify: everything, and a press on Open vsys hands the
# stand-in terminal the vsys TUI's argv. A notice whose run fails, or
# cannot start, goes out again on the next status; runs waiting for a
# press stop at eight, the rest going without the button; and a run that
# ends gives its place back.
# Eight controls are copies of the plugin installed over the bundled one:
# a logic copy that ignores staleness reads the stale document as calm, a
# service copy whose timer derives nothing keeps the ageing status calm
# past its stale moment, a logic copy that hands the view each lane's
# scope unit draws it in the panel, a panel copy that keeps its last
# summary line when a new run starts still draws it after a failed run, a
# notices copy without episode memory sends a lane's notice again on its
# next tick, a service copy that keeps a failed run's episodes sends them
# once only, one that never counts a waiting run offers the button on
# every run, and one that never gives a place back sends later notices
# without the button.
# The harness starts the plugin disabled; the row ends with it disabled,
# its runtime files gone and no stub on PATH.
