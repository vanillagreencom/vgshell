# Dev Tools, vgs.devtools. The plugin runs over harness.sh's
# devtools_stand_ins in the shell's own PATH directory: a mise whose
# installs are one key per line of a file the row writes, a docker and a
# podman that hold no container, and a pacman that owns no file, so every
# probe the engine and the core's
# commands make reaches a stand-in or reads the host's PATH. The row picks
# an agent whose command that PATH does not hold, so it lists absent on any
# host. harness.sh's stand-in terminal records the argv of every run and
# runs the install TUI as `true`, never the plugin's script
# (scripts/test-devtools.sh runs it), so a run ends at once; the row
# writes the key mise then holds itself, before the click.
# Rows: the service publishes the status its manifest declares; IPC open
# summons the window, which is read as every application window is
# (app_window_rows, scripts/smoke/app-window.sh) and, opened again, draws
# the VGS section and every catalog section from the published catalog; a
# click on the agent's Install records the install TUI's argv, and the list
# is read again once that run ended; the window's switch writes
# writeLaunchers, whose launcher verb writes and then removes the agent's
# launcher; the VGS section lists a fixture's missing
# requirement once the core's scan reports it, and its Install raises the
# core's requirement notice; the doctor capability answers for the core's
# commands and refuses a disabled or unknown owner; the Settings page reads
# the status rows back; on a narrow monitor the VGS row's own Details
# opens its clipped error while database rows a failing docker the row
# plants leaves unknown draw Details too; and, as the controls, a copy of
# the plugin whose service ignores a run's end and a change of the scan's
# missing commands leaves the list as it was after each.
