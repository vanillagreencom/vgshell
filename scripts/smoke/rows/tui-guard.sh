# The stand-in terminal's rule (terminal_stand_in in harness.sh): it runs
# no plugin script but a fixture's, so no row reaches a script that could
# change the host. Runs after every row that opens a TUI, before
# rows/auth-sentinel.sh. It reads that the stand-in on the shell's PATH is
# the text terminal_stand_in last wrote, that the frozen fixture index
# still matches the tree's fixtures and cannot be written, and that every
# script the stand-in refused during the run is one a shipped plugin
# declares: a refusal of anything else is a row that pointed the stand-in
# at a script that is neither a fixture nor a shipped TUI. The controls
# call the stand-in with the argv the real launcher hands it: an exact copy
# of acme.tui's wait.sh runs and ends with its code, while a planted
# script, a changed copy of wait.sh, the copy under another plugin's id
# and a path that leaves tui/ each run nothing, end with code 0 and add one
# refusal line each. A planted refusal log naming a made-up script fails
# the shipped-script reading once.
