# The Bluetooth pairing agent, capability `bluetoothAgent` (D085), over
# the bluetoothctl stand-in on the shell's PATH
# (docs/architecture/validation-smoke-devices.md): the child the core
# starts is the stand-in, which replays the transcript the row plants and
# records its argv and every stdin line. No row reaches the host's BlueZ
# or system bus.
#
# The fixture acme.pairing holds the capability and drives it over IPC.
# Rows, over the first transcript: a lease reads pending when begin
# returns and ready once the stand-in printed the default acknowledgement;
# the child ran as `bluetoothctl --agent KeyboardDisplay` and read
# `default-agent`; the confirm prompt the transcript prints shows as one
# request with its code; answering it true writes `yes`; release writes
# `agent off`, closes stdin, and the lending record reads no child and no
# lease. The core writes each of its own commands after 17 spaces, so no
# held prompt accepts one (docs/architecture/bluetooth-agent.md), and the
# stand-in reads them so. Over the second: a copy of the fixture under another id, which
# names the capability, is not built while acme.pairing holds it and is
# built once acme.pairing is disabled; disabling acme.pairing with its lease
# held ends the child after `agent off` and EOF and releases its hold. The
# control is the third transcript, which answers the default-agent request
# with a failure: the same lease reads refused with that reason and no
# child is left. Every poll is expect_poll's: 25 reads 0.2 s apart. The
# rival's absence is rival_absent's: 10 reads 0.2 s apart, after its
# enabled flag reads True.
