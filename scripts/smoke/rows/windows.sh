# Application windows: the Settings window, vgs.settings' `window` kind,
# is a Hyprland window. app_window_rows (scripts/smoke/app-window.sh) reads
# it as every application window is read: one client of the shell's class
# titled Settings, floating, centred and focused, its border in the active
# and inactive colours, moved and focused by dispatches, and closed by an
# Escape it has the keyboard for, which the list page leaves to the window
# host, and by none it does not. The rows here add what Settings alone
# shows: the float comes from the Hyprland layer's `vgs:window` rule, which
# disabled tiles a new window; float toggles tile and float it while the
# helper keeps the keyboard, so a focus dispatch alone returns it; typed
# keys reach its search field and not the helper, then the helper and not
# the field; and a close through Hyprland closes it. The themes panel, a
# panel the host draws as a layer surface, is the control of the class,
# the border and the move: it is no client, its edge draws no border and a
# dispatch aimed at it moves nothing. The row enables the Settings plugin
# and leaves it disabled, hyprland.lua as it found it and no window open.
