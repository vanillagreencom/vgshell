# Automations, vgs.automations. The harness starts it disabled; this row
# enables it over the harness's automations_stand_ins in the shell's own
# PATH directory: a systemctl that logs every verb, a systemd-run that logs
# its argv and runs the argv after `--`, a notify-send that logs its argv
# and prints an id; the harness's loginctl sentinel, which answers
# show-user with lingering off, and its crontab stand-in serve the whole
# run. No call can reach the
# host's systemd user manager or the user's crontab: the sandbox's runtime
# directory and session bus are its own, and every command the plugin runs
# resolves to a stand-in first. The row drives the engine, bin/automations,
# as the shell's service runs it, with the shell's environment.
#
# Rows: the service publishes its declared status, and its start with no
# automation runs no systemctl verb but show-environment; crontab resolves
# to the stand-in, with a control reading the host's PATH; an automation the
# engine adds writes its timer and service under the sandbox home, enables
# the timer and reaches only the stand-in crontab; the service counts it
# scheduled from the store change alone; a failed sync stays the Engine
# status after a list succeeds and clears once a sync succeeds; a
# failing Run now goes through systemd-run, sends the error notification
# with the VGS hints and reaches the Last runs status through the service's
# runs listing; the linger TUI opens through the stand-in terminal, from
# the IPC and from the Settings page's Enable while logged out, whose run's
# end lists lingering again and withdraws the action; the Automations
# window creates, edits, pauses, runs, removes and clears through the
# nested seat's pointer and keyboard alone, the CLI only reading each
# result back; and the control, a copy of the plugin whose service lists
# neither after a run file lands nor after the store changes and whose
# window's engine door drops every write and skips the transcript TUI,
# leaves the count as it was after the engine pauses the automation, Last
# runs as it was after the next failing run, and the store, the history
# and the TUI record as they were after the same clicks and keys. The row
# ends with the plugin disabled, its stand-ins removed and the shim files
# they covered restored.
