# System steps, D081, over the sandbox's device fakes
# (docs/architecture/validation-smoke-host.md). bin/vgshell-system pins its
# PATH to the system directories and derives every path from its
# `prefix=` line, so before the fixture is enabled devices_system_tree
# rewrites the sandbox copy's line to the fakes' tree. That tree's sys and
# dev are links to the fakes' sysfs and device trees, whose HID fake plants
# a Pro Display XDR as hidraw0 beside two Studio Displays; the row closes
# hidraw0 to the user and gives its mode back at the end. Its udevadm,
# systemctl and gum are links to
# the fakes' stand-ins, answering from device_reply; for the trigger
# the row stands over the udevadm stand-in with a script that opens the
# node while the VGS rule exists and then runs the stand-in, which
# records the call. The rest of the tree is not a device: the records,
# the rules directory, a boot id, coreutils, the bash the stand-ins start
# under, since the step resolves every command in this tree alone, a stat
# that reports the user's own files as root's as they read under the
# stand-in sudo's unshare -r, and as sudo a copy of the harness's sudo
# sentinel, which logs to the one authentication log and runs nothing. No probe or command
# reaches the host's /dev, /sys, systemctl, tailscale or sudo. greetd.service
# reads not-found, so the greeter step reads absent before it looks further.
#
# The fixture acme.system declares the apple-displays step and publishes
# its state as status. Rows: the core probes once the fixture holds
# `system` and lends the declared step alone; the step reads needed and
# offers Allow; Allow, through the manager's act, hands the stand-in
# terminal `vgshell system apply apple-displays` as the core TUI core/system;
# while that run is held, the row runs the same command on a terminal
# over a sudo stand-in it stands over the tree's sentinel with
# sentinel_stand_over, puts the sentinel back with sentinel_restore, and
# reads the state still needed, since the core probes on its own only when
# a run ends; the run's end then flips the state to ready, the action is no
# longer offered and the manager refuses it. With the node closed again,
# the step reads ready until a plugin scan ends, then needed. The refusals
# are the row's controls: a disabled fixture's act and a ready step's act
# are refused and start no terminal, and the readings before the run's end
# and before the scan show each flip is that re-probe's. The fixture's own
# Allow then goes through `status.act`, scoped to the calling plugin: the
# same step opens core/system, and an act on the status fixture's `token`
# reads undeclared and starts no terminal, its control.
# rows/auth-sentinel.sh, the last row, reads the log empty. Every reading
# is expect_poll's: 25 reads 0.2 s apart.
