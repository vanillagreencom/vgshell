# Show in bar: setPluginPlaced takes a widget off the bar and puts it back
# in its default section and never writes disabledPlugins. Over the installed
# fixture acme.probe, a service plus a bar widget that rows/plugins.sh
# enabled and placed, each call is read back from the bar's build records,
# the user shell.json, listPlugins and the service's build record:
# unplacing keeps the plugin enabled and its service built, and neither
# call changes disabledPlugins. The three refusals leave the file as it
# was. The Settings page's Show in bar switch is clicked twice and read
# back the same way, and the page of acme.tick, a widget-only fixture,
# draws no such switch. The row restores the user file byte for byte, so the
# rows after it find the fixture placed as before, and leaves Settings
# disabled.
