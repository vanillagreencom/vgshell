# The sandbox's device fakes (scripts/smoke/devices.sh), the base every
# System row builds on. The row starts them, reads the guard over the
# running shell, then reads each fake through the shell as a section
# reads it: the acme.devices fixture lists the BlueZ mock's adapter and
# device, the NetworkManager mock's Wi-Fi device and the private PipeWire's
# null nodes through Quickshell's singletons, and runs rfkill through the
# shell's own PATH. It reads the voice feed end to end: a tone played into
# its sink is in what a recorder on its source took, the feed reads ready
# only while that recorder reads it, and a recorder with nothing played
# takes silence. It reads that neither the sandbox PipeWire nor its
# WirePlumber holds a sound or camera node after WirePlumber has loaded
# its profile, that the rfkill block changed
# the stand-in's state file alone, that a stand-in answers only what a row
# planted, and the HID fake's answers. Its controls: each guard rule
# turns red on a process given the shell's environment words with one
# host value after them, as a harness edit that leaked it would hand the
# shell; devices_ready maps a guard leak to not measured and fails an
# unreadable shell pid; the fd reader finds the /dev/null PipeWire holds;
# a stand-in copy that drops its state write leaves the radio unblocked;
# and a host without python-dbusmock reads not measured through
# devices_ready. The host's radios are read before and after the block,
# never written; no edit here could make that reading differ without a
# hardware write, so it has no control. The row leaves the fakes up,
# clears the reply it plants, and leaves the fixture disabled for the
# System rows.
