# The System window, vgs.system: the holder of the exclusive `panes`
# capability (D088), a Hyprland window titled System. Over four copies of
# the acme.pane fixture, three enabled in two groups and one left disabled,
# the row reads the sidebar listing exactly the enabled sections under
# their groups in the capability's order; `{}` opening the first section,
# then the one shown last; a deep link mounting its section with the rest
# of the payload; an unknown id opening with a notice; the plugin's own
# open and toggle IPC; an own-pane summon; each switch destroying the
# section before it in the window host's build records; a click on Show in
# bar placing and removing the fixture widget, offered only to a section
# with one; a section taller than the room scrolling in the page and a
# shorter one filling it; the selection staying on its section as another
# joins and leaves; a disabled section leaving the sidebar while the
# window is open; the window read as every application window is (app_window_rows,
# scripts/smoke/app-window.sh); its edges within one pixel; and a keyboard
# path from SUPER+COMMA to every step and back out. Shell & Plugins hands
# the Settings summon command (docs/architecture/settings-window.md) to a
# stand-in vgsh in the shell's own PATH directory, which records its argv
# and runs nothing.
#
# Controls: a copy of the window that keeps the list it read when it
# opened lists a section disabled while it is open, and a shell copy whose
# PaneHost hands the holder no pane height shows the tall section cut to
# the room. The row reads no latency. It starts with no other panes holder
# installed and every enabled shipped section set aside, so the sidebar
# lists its fixtures alone, and leaves the user file, vgs.system's and
# each shipped section's enablement, the plugins directory and the shell's
# PATH directory as it found them.
