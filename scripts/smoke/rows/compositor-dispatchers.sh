# The compositor provider's window, monitor and pointer operations, sent
# through the existing acme.probe dispatch handle. Read each effect from
# Hyprland, not from the queue's `ok`. Before each effect, a hyprctl copy
# answers `ok` without dispatching: the same state assertion must fail
# once. The control logs stay in the sandbox. State polls use the shared
# expect_poll interval of 200 ms; no latency budget is measured here.
# Fullscreen is focused-window-only in both dialects. Move and resize are
# absolute layout coordinates and size, respectively.
# Repeated sets wait for a distinct pointer move queued behind them before
# reading the already-matching state. A toggle control uses that same read.
