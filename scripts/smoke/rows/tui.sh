# Floating TUIs through the `tui` capability and the core's `listTuis` and
# `openTui`, read back from a stand-in xdg-terminal-exec in the shell's own
# PATH directory. The real bin/vgshell-tui launches it; it records the argv it
# was handed, maps the harness's toplevel helper with the app-id and title
# it was handed as the window, and runs the real presenter with no terminal
# behind it, so the presenter writes its exit records and no terminal
# starts. The fixture acme.tui declares one listed script and one gated
# one, which waits for a file the row creates, polled every 0.05 s for at
# most 20 s, and the Update entry scripts/smoke/rows/launcher.sh opens.
# Rows: the published list, the app-id of the script's size, the snapshot
# path it runs from and its arguments, the core's own sudo grant and package
# install picker opened by key as the core's bin/vgshell, each refusal, a
# launcher that finds no terminal and the synchronous `launcher-missing`
# answer that follows until a probe finds one again, the launchers the core
# holds, a run's `done` and state from its exit records, a second run of a
# live key refused busy with its window focused, a destroyed instance's
# `done` dropped while its run ends, a live run that fails harness.sh's
# expect_run_end at its ceiling, a presenter copy that writes no ended
# record, whose run the core's `vgshell-tui wait` ends, and a disabled plugin's
# list and hold gone.
