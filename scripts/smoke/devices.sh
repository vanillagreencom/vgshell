# Sourced by harness.sh; owns the sandbox's device fakes, the stand-ins
# for device commands and the guards a device row starts behind
# (docs/architecture/validation.md § Host safety). No smoke row may reach
# the host's audio, radios, network, VPN, DDC or hidraw: the sandbox shares
# the host's devices and files.
#
# The contract a row builds on:
# - devices_env_words, which the harness puts in every sandbox process's
#   environment: PIPEWIRE_RUNTIME_DIR names the sandbox runtime dir, and
#   VGS_DEV_ROOT, VGS_SYSFS_ROOT and VGS_HID_FAKE name the brightness
#   helper's device tree, sysfs tree and feature-report socket under the
#   sandbox.
# - The stand-ins, device_stand_in_names, each $shim/<name>, first on
#   every sandbox shell's PATH for the whole run: each records its argv
#   and answers from files a row plants, never the host's command
#   (scripts/smoke/fixtures/devices/stand-in.py). device_reply plants an
#   answer, device_reply_clear removes a stand-in's planted answers,
#   device_transcript a bluetoothctl session, device_calls reads the
#   record. A row that needs a stand-in to answer its own way stands over
#   it with sentinel_stand_over and puts it back with sentinel_restore,
#   as with the authentication sentinels.
# - bluez drives the planted adapter as BlueZ would, bluez_follow makes
#   the rfkill stand-in move it as bluetoothd follows rfkill, and
#   rfkill_hard moves a hardware switch, for a Bluetooth row.
# - devices_up starts the fakes once per run, on a row's first call, and
#   leaves them up: python-dbusmock's bluez5 and networkmanager templates
#   on the sandbox system bus with one adapter, one device and one Wi-Fi
#   device planted, a private PipeWire and WirePlumber with null nodes
#   only, and the HID feature-report fake. Quickshell 0.3.1's Bluetooth,
#   Networking and Pipewire singletons look for their service once, when
#   a plugin first reads them, and never watch for it to appear
#   (bluetooth/bluez.cpp, network/nm/backend.cpp,
#   services/pipewire/connection.cpp), so a row calls it before it enables
#   a plugin that reads one.
# - devices_ready ROW, a device row's first line: devices_up, then
#   devices_guard over the running shell. A missing prerequisite or a
#   guard that reads a leak records ROW not measured and returns 1, and
#   the row returns; an unreadable shell environment or a fake that fails
#   to start fails the row.
