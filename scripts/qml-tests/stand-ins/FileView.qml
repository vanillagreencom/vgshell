import QtQuick

// Stands in for Quickshell.Io's FileView, whose plugin does not load outside
// the shell. It arms an initial read and watcher when a path is assigned, so
// a test can create a view and then set its path as production QML does. It
// has the two behaviours WatchedFile works around
// (docs/architecture/runtime-qml.md): a reload while the view's read or
// write is outstanding, a result handler included, starts nothing, and a
// reload of a watching view builds its watcher again. A read or a write
// that starts during a result handler's run is lost once the handler
// returns. Nothing touches a disk: the test finishes each operation.
