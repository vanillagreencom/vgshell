// The automations judge, shell/plugins/vgs.automations/AutomationsLogic.js,
// under node: the recurrence judge and its presets, the schedule compiler's
// OnCalendar= expressions and cron fields, the summary line, the next
// occurrences, the runner's guard, the store and guard-state judges, the
// unit and crontab text, the run records and history rows, pruning, and the
// notifications a run sends. Every expected value is written out by hand.
//
// The preview rows compare the judge's next ten occurrences with
// `systemd-analyze calendar --iterations` on the expressions it compiles,
// read-only, under UTC and under a zone with daylight saving. A rule
// OnCalendar= states exactly must give the same instants; a rule the guard
// narrows (an interval, an end) must give a subset of them, and a row names
// an instant the guard drops. Without systemd-analyze the suite runs every
// other row and its controls, then exits 77: not a pass.
//
// The controls at the end edit a copy of the judge, one rule at a time, and
// require this suite to fail on each copy.
