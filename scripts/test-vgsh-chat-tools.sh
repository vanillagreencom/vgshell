# Controls for the chat and tool targets of `vgsh theme apply`: Vesktop,
# Equibop, Vencord, btop, fastfetch, tmux, Oh My Posh and Obsidian. Each
# lands its file with its encoder and keeps its wiring, links in the
# application's theme directory or tmux's source-file line, and each hook
# reaches only a stub. Obsidian's links stand in every vault its registry
# lists, the entry form's `vaults`. Every detect command, the signal command
# and tmux are stubs on the rows' PATH, under a temporary HOME,
# XDG_CONFIG_HOME and XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, so no row reaches a real application,
# a tmux server or the developer's session.
