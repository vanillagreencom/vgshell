#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Drive scripts/sample-shell-memory.sh: its --report mode, its argument
# refusals, its pid resolution and its row builder. No case needs a live shell.
# The report mode reads a TSV and prints keyed lines, so every report case is a
# fixture log. Pid resolution asks the checkout's bin/vgsh, which reads
# $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/vgsh.lock, then runs `qs list -p <checkout>/shell -j`, so its
# cases run the sampler under an explicit environment whose runtime dir holds a
# lock file this test writes, whose checkout holds a copy of bin/vgsh and whose
# PATH holds a stub qs that replies what the case says. The row builder
# reads /proc for whatever pid it holds, so it is driven against a process this
# file spawns, and one sampling run is driven end to end against that process.
#
# Each case pins the refusal or report key, the value it carries, and the exit
# status. The controls at the end plant one defect per report rule and require
# the case that rule owns to go red.
#
# Every copy of the script under test runs from a plain temporary directory with
# no repository beside it. --report must work there: the sampling path is the
# only part that asks the runner, runs qs or names the checkout. Staging a
# checkout-shaped tree here would hide a --report that started to depend on one,
# so the copies stay bare on purpose; the pid-resolution cases alone stage
# bin/vgsh under the copy's checkout, the copy's parent directory.
