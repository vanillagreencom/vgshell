# Controls for `vgsh lock`, bin/vgsh-lock: the call it makes on vgs.lock's
# IPC target of the shell the instance lock names, its answer taken from
# qs's last stdout line, the wait for the compositor's answer in the
# plugin's status reply, and each refusal. A stub qs, first on the suite's
# PATH, records the argv of its lock call and answers it from STUB_REPLY
# and STUB_STATUS after STUB_NOISE; it answers the first status call from
# STUB_BEFORE and every later one from STUB_AFTER. STUB_CLIENT_FAILURE
# answers every call with that line and exit 0, as Quickshell 0.3.1's
# client answers a failure of its own. The instance lock names
# this suite's own pid, a live process that is no shell. Expected values
# are the ones each row planted.
