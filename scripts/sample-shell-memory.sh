# Sample the live shell's memory read-only and report growth per class.

# Resolving which process is the shell asks the runner (`bin/vgsh pid`) and reads
# the Quickshell instance list once. Every sample after that is /proc alone. Nothing
# here signals, restarts or drives the shell, so it is safe to leave running
# across a whole session. It is a diagnostic tool, not a validation check:
# scripts/validate drives it through scripts/test-sample-shell-memory.sh, whose
# --report cases read a TSV and need no running shell and whose pid-resolution
# cases run against a lock file and an instance list the test writes.
#
#   scripts/sample-shell-memory.sh                 sample until interrupted
#   scripts/sample-shell-memory.sh --hours 26      sample for 26 hours
#   scripts/sample-shell-memory.sh --samples 3     take three samples
#   scripts/sample-shell-memory.sh --report FILE   summarise an existing log
#
# The log is one TSV row per sample. Every row carries the sampled pid with the
# process start time that tells one session from the next reusing that pid.
#
# Output protocol, pinned by scripts/test-sample-shell-memory.sh: every refusal
# and every report line begins with a key=value field, English follows on its own
# line. Refusals exit 2 for a bad invocation, an unusable header or a shell that
# cannot be resolved, and 1 for a log that cannot be read as one session or a
# run that ended before the samples --samples asked for (samples-short=).
# Resolution refuses with the runner's own key (shell=not-running when
# $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/vgsh.lock is missing, holds no pid on its first line or names
# a pid with no process), runner=missing when this checkout has no bin/vgsh, and
# shell=unlisted when `qs list` does not list that pid under this checkout's
# shell. --report reports the newest session in
# the log alone and emits, for that session: one mark= line for each of 1 h, 8 h,
# 24 h of uptime and the last sample; one rate=window line over the session's
# whole logged span; and one rate= line for each consecutive pair of marks. Every
# rate names the uptimes it spans and is gated on the rate floor.
