"""The QML and JavaScript source lines a static check reads.

`check-plugin-boundary.py`, `check-design-tokens.py` and
`check-pointer-cursor.py` walk the same files the way the shell lists them,
through `bin/vgsh-scan`, and read code only: line comments, block comments
and trailing comments are blanked before matching, with line numbers kept. String literals stay, so a name inside a string handed
to `Qt.createQmlObject` is still a finding.

A directory or file the walk cannot read raises `Unreadable`, and the caller
ends its run: an incomplete traversal never certifies a tree.
