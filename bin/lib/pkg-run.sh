#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bin/lib/pkg-run.sh: runs the steps of one package plan in the terminal
# the user sees. bin/vgsh-pkg's `run` decides everything first (the caller,
# the terminal, the plan and the elevation command) and then starts this
# file with bash, so the steps run under bin/lib/tui.sh's sudo session. The
# vgs.devtools engine starts it with ELEVATOR none for its mise, container
# and installer steps, so every step a floating TUI runs is shown alike.
#
#   pkg-run.sh ELEVATOR COUNT ARG... [COUNT ARG...]...
#
# ELEVATOR is `sudo`, `doas`, `run0` or `none`. Each step is COUNT, a
# positive number, then that many arguments, the step's argv. The steps
# reach this file as argv from node, never as a shell string, and run as
# lists: a package name holding `$(...)` stays one literal word.
#
# The steps run in the directory this file starts in, which bin/vgsh-pkg
# sets to $HOME. Each step runs in order with ELEVATOR before it, unless
# ELEVATOR is none,
# after a step line in the theme accent. The first step that fails ends the
# run with its exit status. Under sudo every run holds one sudo session
# (tui.sh's vgs_tui_sudo_session): the password is asked once, before the
# first step, and the credential is dropped when the run ends, whatever the
# number of steps. A run started inside another script's sudo session, as
# the Updates pipeline starts `vgsh pkg run upgrade`, joins that session and
# leaves the credential to its owner. doas and run0 get no keepalive: each
# step asks as the system's own rules say, doas.conf's `persist` or polkit's
# `auth_admin_keep`, since neither has a command that refreshes a
# credential without running a program as root.
#
# The ending, Done or Failed, is `vgsh-tui present`'s: this file prints no
# verdict. A bad invocation prints `vgsh: refused: pkg-run=<key>` and exits
# 2; a sudo session that cannot start exits 1 after tui.sh's refusal line.
