## Project Instructions

<!-- kendex:shared-instructions:start -->
Problems with a kendex-owned skill go through `kendex report`; check ownership in the file first.

VGS delivery policy overrides the shared workflow's mandatory review, CI-wait, branch-size and commit-hook gates. Work targets main. Reviews and PRs are optional; push directly or merge a PR immediately with gh, without a review loop, queue or CI wait. Do not arm git guards. Run scripts/validate once on the final relevant diff; use --changed <last-validated-commit> for a fix round, and reuse passing results while those inputs are unchanged. Do not rerun a full battery at commit, push or submission. Use --full only for an explicit full sweep or an unmapped dependency. Keep the live-session safety rules.

# vgs-plugin

Write a plugin for the VGS shell. The contract is [`docs/architecture/plugins.md`](../../../docs/architecture/plugins.md); this skill holds the steps, the scaffold command and the templates.

```bash
.agents/skills/vgs-plugin/scripts/vgs-plugin new acme.weather --kinds bar-widget,service
.agents/skills/vgs-plugin/scripts/vgs-plugin check shell/plugins/acme.weather
```

## Rules

- Consumer text follows [`docs/architecture/copy.md`](../../../docs/architecture/copy.md).

- One directory, one `manifest.json` at its root, one QML entry point per kind. Copy the templates. The field table is [`docs/architecture/plugin-manifest.md` § Manifest](../../../docs/architecture/plugin-manifest.md#manifest); an unknown key is refused.
- Declare surfaces, never dependencies. Every external command the plugin runs goes in the manifest's `requirements`, with its package per manager, `optional` when the plugin works without it, and a one-line `purpose`; a requirement names a command, never another plugin: [`docs/architecture/requirements.md`](../../../docs/architecture/requirements.md). The core shows its notice when the plugin is installed or enabled without a command it needs; a button that asks the user to install one of the plugin's own commands calls `shell.requirements.offer`, never a package manager.
- Imports and names: the allowed table in [`references/api.md`](references/api.md) § Allowed imports, and nothing else. `scripts/check-plugin-boundary.py` refuses the rest.
- Every entry point declares `property var shell: null` or inherits it from `BarWidget`. Capabilities come from `shell.<name>` after naming them in `capabilities`; a widget never reads them from `bar`.
- Settings default in the manifest's `settings` and arrive as `shell.settings` for every kind; a bar widget also reads them with `setting(name, fallback)`. A change reaches the running instance as a new `shell`; hold no copy.
- The manifest is the plugin's settings page: name an `icon` from the shipped Lucide set, and give every setting a user would reasonably change, and the plugin reads, a `schema` entry, with `min`, `max`, `step` and `unit` on a number, `presets` on a format-like value, `allowCustom` only when custom values are useful, and a `group` for its section; a string without `presets` or `optionsFrom` is refused. A constant earns an entry only when a user has a reason to change it. A key is `hyprland.binds`, never a schema entry; the Settings page's Keys row captures a pressed combo for it with `ShortcutField`. The Settings window draws the page from these alone: [`docs/architecture/plugin-manifest.md` § Manifest](../../../docs/architecture/plugin-manifest.md#manifest), [D032](../../../docs/decisions/D032-settings-plugin-and-manifest-settings-convention.md), [D077](../../../docs/decisions/D077-settings-schema-presets-and-row-rhythm.md).
- A bar widget extends `BarWidget` from `qs.Ui` and sizes itself with `implicitWidth` and `implicitHeight`. The core assigns `bar`, `moduleName`, `settings` and `frame` after creation; the widget sets none of them. `BarWidget` gives every widget its right-click Hide; a widget takes no right click of its own.
- A bar declares `leftSection`, `centerSection` and `rightSection`. The core mounts every plugin widget; a widget the bar draws itself registers through `shell.builtins`.
- A surface the user works in, moves or tiles, such as a settings or tools window, is kind `window`, a Hyprland window; a section inside a System-style holder is kind `pane` and starts from `templates/Pane.qml`; a flyout from a widget is an anchored `panel` or `menu`, which closes on a click outside it: [`docs/architecture/surfaces.md`](../../../docs/architecture/surfaces.md), [D044](../../../docs/decisions/D044-application-windows-are-hyprland-toplevels.md).
- Compose the components of `qs.Ui` ([`references/api.md` § Components in `qs.Ui`](references/api.md#components-in-qsui)) before drawing anything by hand. Every colour, size, font, radius, opacity and duration reads a token through `Theme` in `qs.Commons`. `scripts/check-design-tokens.py` refuses a `Theme` path that names no token and reports each literal it finds.
- Keyboard support is first class: follow [`docs/architecture/keyboard.md`](../../../docs/architecture/keyboard.md) for each pointer action and focusable control.
- Before choosing a default key, check common Hyprland bindings and avoid Super with H/J/K/L, W/A/S/D or a digit.
- A list whose rows each take one selection declares one `ListCursor` from `qs.Ui` and names it in each row's `cursor`; keys write the list's one selection, a hover moves the plate and, in a pick list, the selection, and no row draws its own hover or highlight fill: [`docs/architecture/motion.md`](../../../docs/architecture/motion.md).
- A plugin whose design must look the same under every theme owns its look instead: the manifest's `appearance` names a table of its own, every value is `look.<path>` from `Theme.appearance(TOKENS, LIGHT)`, and the theme reaches it through its mode, accent and motion scale alone. [`docs/architecture/appearance.md`](../../../docs/architecture/appearance.md) is the contract; it reads no other `Theme` member.
- One owner per timer, watcher, poller and subprocess, inside the entry point's tree. A `Process` gets its stdout parser before it starts.
- A value the plugin's widgets, flyout or Settings page show is plugin status: declare it in the manifest's `status`, name capability `status`, write it from the one instance that owns its source, the service, with `shell.status.set`, and read it from `shell.status.values`. One writer per key; a credential's value never enters status, only its presence. [`docs/architecture/status.md`](../../../docs/architecture/status.md), [D037](../../../docs/decisions/D037-plugin-status.md).
- A plugin that needs a Hyprland key, a blur rule or an input option declares it as data in the manifest's `hyprland` key and never writes Hyprland configuration: the core renders it into the one Hyprland layer, [`docs/architecture/hyprland.md`](../../../docs/architecture/hyprland.md). An input option maps a schema setting through `hyprland.options` and reads Hyprland back through capability `hyprland`, never its own `hyprctl`: [`docs/architecture/hyprland-options.md`](../../../docs/architecture/hyprland-options.md). A plugin reads the outputs through capability `monitors` and sets no monitor rule, through `hyprctl keyword`, `eval` or a file: the user's own Hyprland config sets every output, [`docs/architecture/hyprland-monitors.md`](../../../docs/architecture/hyprland-monitors.md).
- No manual commands ([D061](../../../docs/decisions/D061-no-manual-commands.md)): a setup step is automatic or one click. Give the status entry that shows it an `action`, the plugin's own TUI, its own requirement commands or a step of the core's root setup table it declares in `systemSteps` ([`docs/architecture/tui-system.md`](../../../docs/architecture/tui-system.md)), and publish when it applies; a credential is a `presenceList` item naming its account of the manifest's `secrets`, which the Settings page connects through a masked field. A command a user could run shows only as the entry's `command`, behind Show command, never in a README step, a hint or a notice: [`docs/architecture/status-actions.md` § Actions and secrets](../../../docs/architecture/status-actions.md#actions-and-secrets). `vgs-plugin check` runs `scripts/check-user-commands.py`.
- Consumer features need no developer setup ([D075](../../../docs/decisions/D075-consumer-features-need-no-developer-setup.md)). A feature that needs an app, API key or token the user must create is an owner-only extra: a setting off by default with no `schema` entry, named in the manifest's `extras` with the status entries and optional requirements only it uses, which the core hides while it is off, and documented under "Extras (not supported)" in the README: [`docs/architecture/plugin-manifest.md` § Manifest](../../../docs/architecture/plugin-manifest.md#manifest).
- A command the user must see or answer runs in a floating TUI: a script under the plugin's `tui/`, declared as data in the manifest's `tui` key and opened with `shell.tui.run`, never a command string: [`docs/architecture/tui-capability.md` § The capability](../../../docs/architecture/tui-capability.md#the-capability).
- No cache keyed by data other applications supply without a ceiling.
- Every Quickshell type, property and signal comes from the 0.3.1 reference on Context7: `ctx7 docs /websites/quickshell_v0_3_1 <query>`.
- A first-party plugin's README shows a screenshot made by `scripts/readme-shots.sh`, with its row in `docs/images/plugins/shots.tsv`: [`docs/architecture/readme-images.md`](../../../docs/architecture/readme-images.md).
- Land with `scripts/validate manifests`, `scripts/validate boundary` and `scripts/validate qml` clean, the last with the readback rows [`workflows/new-plugin.md`](workflows/new-plugin.md) step 9 names.
