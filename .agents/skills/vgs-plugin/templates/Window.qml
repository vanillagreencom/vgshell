// __NAME__ window: an application window the core's window host builds as a
// Hyprland toplevel titled with the manifest's name. Hyprland draws its
// border, gives it the keyboard when it is focused, and moves, floats,
// tiles and closes it like any other window; the plugin never creates a
// window and draws no frame of its own. The implicit size is the first size
// the window asks for; the content fills whatever size Hyprland gives it
// after. A close through Hyprland reaches close() like a hide, and so does
// an Escape no item here accepts while the window has the keyboard.
