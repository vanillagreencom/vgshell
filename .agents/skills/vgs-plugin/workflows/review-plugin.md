# Review a plugin

Run the checks first, then read. A finding names the rule and the line.

1. `.agents/skills/vgs-plugin/scripts/vgs-plugin check <dir>`: manifest, boundary, design tokens and pointer cursor. Exit 0 passes; any other exit requires investigation. Success lines are not findings.
2. Open every entry point and confirm: `shell` is declared or inherited from `BarWidget`, no entry point assigns `moduleName`, `bar` or `settings` (the core does), every timer, `Process`, `FileView` and connection sits inside the entry point's tree, no capability is read from `bar`, no copy of `shell.settings` is held past the assignment, each `status` key has one writer, the instance that owns its source, and no status value holds a credential.
3. Confirm the plugin composes `qs.Ui` components where one fits, and every colour, size, font, radius, opacity and duration it draws itself reads `Theme`.
4. Confirm any compositor call goes through `shell.<capability>` and the capability is in the manifest.
5. For a `tui` key, confirm every script is an executable file under `tui/`, the plugin opens it only through `shell.tui.run`, and no command string reaches `shell.run.detached` or a `Process` in its place.
6. For a bar, confirm it declares the three section containers, leaves plugin widgets to the core, and registers its own built-in widgets through `shell.builtins`.
7. Confirm the smoke rows exist as [`new-plugin.md`](new-plugin.md) step 9 lists them for the plugin's kinds, that a planted defect turned one red, and the result of `scripts/validate qml` is reported accurately; exit 77 is not measured, never a pass.
