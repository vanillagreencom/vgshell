// The one cursor of a list: a plate under the row that holds the list's
// selection. It travels to the next row and takes its height rather than
// lighting each row, fades in while `shown` and out while not, and lands at
// once after `snap()` and while hidden, so it appears where it lands.
// `shown` holds while a row holds the cursor; a list that knows whether it
// has a selection, and rebuilds its rows under it, binds it instead, so a
// row it destroys leaves the plate in place for the next.
//
// Keyboard and pointer move the same selection, which the list owns. A row
// hands the cursor itself through `follow(row, holds)` while it holds the
// selection. A hover moves the selection only once `hoverTakes` answers
// true: after `disarm()`, which a keyboard step and a rebuilt list call,
// the pointer must move before it takes the selection again, so a pointer
// resting over a list that moves under it never takes the selection from
// the keyboard.
//
// Declare the cursor in the item that holds the rows, or in any item above
// them that is not a positioner, such as a view's contentItem. It follows
// the row through every item between, by their positions, so it ignores a
// row's transform, such as its entrance. It draws at z -1, under every
// sibling, the rows among them, and so under anything its parent draws
// itself: its parent must draw nothing, and a parent that paints a fill is
// refused with an error. `enterSlot()` places a row that arrives among the
// others of its turn, for ListEntrance.
//
// Every timing and distance is `motion`, `Theme.motion.list` by default. A
// plugin that owns its look hands its own, in the same shape, and its own
// `background`.
