// surface; it is built once per session and destroyed when disabled or when
// its source changes. Variants keeps the slot of every id that stays in
// the list, so enabling or disabling one service rebuilds no other. No
// service builds before ServiceGate releases them, once the first bars
// have presented a frame (D047).
