// An application window: a summon of kind `window`, built as a Hyprland
// toplevel. Its class is the shell's one app-id, which shell.qml's AppId
// pragma sets, and its title is the plugin's manifest name, so the user's
// window rules and keybinds find it; the Hyprland layer's `vgs:window` rule
// floats it and centres it. It draws no border and no radius of its own, so
// Hyprland's decoration is the frame. The window maps once the plugin is
// built, at the plugin's implicit size: Quickshell sends a floating window
// no size change once it is shown, so that size is the first request only,
// and the plugin fills whatever size Hyprland gives the window after. A
// close through Hyprland, such as its killactive key, is `dismissed`, which
// the host treats as a hide, and so is an Escape the plugin leaves
// unaccepted while the window has the keyboard: the slot holds the focus
// the plugin takes none of, and a key the focused item does not accept
// climbs its parents to the slot.
