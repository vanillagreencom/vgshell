// One bar surface per screen. The core owns the window; the active bar
// plugin draws inside the slot and receives the screen through the slot's
// context. The window exists only while a bar instance can be built: a
// disabled, unknown or broken bar leaves no surface and reserves no space,
// so the desktop stays whole. A hidden window would keep its layer
// surface alive; destroying the window is what releases it. The surface is
// mapped only while the bar instance is shown, one without the property
// included: hiding a layer-shell window deletes its Wayland surface, which
// releases the space it reserves, and keeps the instance to show it again.
