// When the service host may build services: once every bar the core built
// for the first applied scan has presented its first frame, so no service
// build delays the first bar (D047). Bars, their widgets and backgrounds
// build in the turn that scan ends; services build on the release, in a
// later turn, and so claim an exclusive capability after every surface
// plugin. The release happens once per shell process and is never taken
// back: a service enabled later, a rescan, a screen change or a bar
// rebuild builds services at once. With no shown bar built for that scan
// (no screen; the active bar disabled, unknown, refused, broken or hidden,
// whose host maps no surface) it releases at once. A bar that never presents, as on a monitor the compositor
// configures no surface for, holds the services for `deadlineMs` at most;
// the release then logs a warning naming the bar hosts that did not
// present.
