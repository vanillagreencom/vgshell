// The theme file and the last document it accepted. Theme holds the one

// file is read the way Config reads shell.json: an absent file is the
// expected case and publishes the defaults, so a file removed while the
// shell runs draws what a fresh start without it would. A file that is
// unreadable or that the judge refuses is logged and leaves the last
// accepted theme; nothing of a refused document is published. WatchedFile
// reads it, so an edit that lands during a read is read again.
