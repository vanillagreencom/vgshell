# Agent Warden

The shield shows whether your AI agents stay within their memory and process limits. Agent Warden alerts you when an agent needs attention. [vsys](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vsys) provides Agent Warden. [D041](../../../docs/decisions/D041-agent-warden-observes-the-vsys-warden.md) defines the plugin's role.

Enabling the plugin on its Settings page puts the shield in the bar's right section.

## Setting up the warden

The plugin's Settings page and its panel offer each setup step as a button, shown only while the step is needed:

1. **Install vsys** in the panel opens the install screen for vsys, the agent dashboard. **Install all missing**, under Requirements on the Settings page, opens it for every missing tool, vsys among them. The Requirements section shows whether vsys is installed.
2. **Set up** opens a setup screen and starts Agent Warden checks.

Beside Set up on the Settings page, Show command reveals the command it runs ([D061](../../../docs/decisions/D061-no-manual-commands.md)). Once Agent Warden runs, the page shows no setup button and no command; its row reads Running while nothing needs attention.

## The shield

The bar widget draws one shield in the tone of the service's state, with the Lucide icon and the `Theme.badge.tone` group below. The words, icons and tones are `ViewLogic.js`.

| State | Icon | Tone | Count | Tooltip, for example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `calm` | `shield-check` | neutral | agents running | 3 agents running within their limits |
| `working` | `shield-check` | accent, one pulse on entering | agents running | Moved 1 agent back into limits 2m ago |
| `look` | `shield-alert` | warning | things that need a look | claude in vgs is using a lot of memory |
| `problem` | `shield-x` | danger | things that need attention | Agents are close to their memory limit |
| `not-checking` | `shield-off` | neutral | none | Agent Warden hasn't checked in 3m |
| `not-set-up` | `shield-question-mark` | neutral | none | Agent Warden isn't set up |
| `update-warden` | `shield-alert` | warning | none | Agent Warden needs an update |

A count of zero is not drawn. A click opens or closes the panel under the shield. The global shortcut `vgs.agent-warden:toggle`, bound to `SUPER+CTRL+Y` by default, opens the same panel at the plugin's placement.

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `showCount` | `true` | Draws the count beside the shield. |
| `hideWhenIdle` | `false` | Hides the shield while the state is `calm` and no agent runs. |
| `notify` | `problems` | Which notices go out: `problems`, `everything` or `off`. [§ Notifications](#notifications) lists each one. |

## The panel

The panel shows the heading Agents, one sentence for the state, at most three items, most serious first, and the agent group's memory against its slowdown point. It opens with keyboard focus on its primary button when one is shown. The meter is hidden when the warden did not report the memory or a limit. No text names a process id or a scope unit, because the published `detail` holds neither. A footer shows the time of the last check and Open vsys, which opens the `vsys` TUI: the vsys dashboard in a wide floating terminal. While vsys is missing, the link is Install vsys.

When vsys is installed, each open runs `vsys --once --summary` once, and the panel shows vsys's verdict on the whole computer as one line: nothing wrong, the number of things worth a look, or the number of problems. It reads only the verdict's levels ([vsys verdict.md § Summary JSON](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/vsys/blob/main/docs/architecture/verdict.md#summary-json)) and never shows a verdict's subject. A run that fails, or a summary of another schema, is logged as `agent-warden: summary=...` and shows no line.

A state that needs a setup step shows one button in place of the items:

| State | Button | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `not-set-up` | Set up | Opens the `setup` TUI, which runs `vsys warden install`. |
| `update-warden` | Update | The same: the installer rewrites an older warden's units. |
| `not-checking`, stale | Start checks | Runs `systemctl --user start agent-warden.timer` through the `run` capability. |
| `not-set-up` or `update-warden` without vsys | Install vsys | Raises the shell's requirement notice for vsys through `shell.requirements.offer`. |

A press that hands off closes the panel. A refusal stays in the panel as one sentence, such as "The setup window could not open. VGS is missing its terminal launcher, xdg-terminal-exec. Reinstall VGS to restore it.", and is logged as `agent-warden: action=<action> <reply>`.

## Notifications

The service sends one desktop notification when something starts to need a look, and again only after it has cleared and comes back. It takes over from the warden's own notices and words them for people. The service's contract, the heartbeat that takes the notices over and the rules for each episode are [agent-warden.md § Notifications](../../../docs/architecture/agent-warden.md#notifications).

| Kind | Scope | Opens when | Title, for example | Urgency | Open vsys |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tasks` | the lane's unit | an agent's lane is near its task ceiling | An agent is near its process limit | normal | yes |
| `memory` | the lane's unit | an agent's lane is near its memory ceiling | An agent is near its memory limit | normal | yes |
| `not-moving` | `agents.slice` | moves wait for memory headroom | Agents are close to their memory limit | critical | yes |
| `move-failure` | the tree's unit | a move failed or left part behind in the last 5 minutes | Some agent processes still have no limits | normal | yes |
| `reaped` | the leftover unit | leftover work was stopped in the last 5 minutes | Cleaned up after a finished agent | low | no |
| `not-checking` | `agent-warden` | the status is stale | Agent Warden has stopped checking | normal | no |
| `moved` | the tree's unit | an agent was moved back into its limits in the last 5 minutes | Moved an agent back into its limits | toast | no |

`problems`, the default, sends every kind but `moved`, which the panel shows. `everything` also shows each move as a toast, the only toast the plugin shows. `off` sends nothing. The cleanups and the moves one status opens go out as one notice. The body gives the numbers from `status.json`, GB for GiB values through `WardenLogic.gib`, and the tool and worktree as the panel names them, and never a process id or a scope unit.

## IPC

| Name | Reply |
|---|---|
| `status` | The published values as one JSON line. |

`bin/vgshell ipc call vgs.agent-warden invoke status`
