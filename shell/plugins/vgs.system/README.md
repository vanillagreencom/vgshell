# System

`vgs.system`: one window for every System section, such as sound, displays and network. A sidebar lists the enabled sections under their groups, and the chosen section fills the page beside it. Each section is its own plugin of kind `pane`. You enable and disable a section in Settings like any plugin. This window lists and shows the enabled sections.

![The System window with no section enabled: the sidebar holds Shell & Plugins, and the page its empty state](../../../docs/images/plugins/vgs.system-window.webp)

Screenshot made with `scripts/readme-shots.sh` in the nested sandbox, with the default theme at scale 2. The sandbox takes the shot with every System section disabled, so the window shows its empty state. The [Displays](../vgs.displays/README.md) and [Sound](../vgs.sound/README.md) READMEs show the window with their section open.

## Opening it

| How | What it opens |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+COMMA` | The section shown last, or the first. The same key closes the window. Settings' Keys row rebinds it. |
| A section's own Settings link | That section. |
| IPC | `vgshell ipc call vgs.system invoke toggle '<payload>'` or `... invoke open '<payload>'`, or the host's `vgshell ipc call shell summon window vgs.system '<payload>'`. |

The payload is `{}` for the section shown last, or `{"pane":"<id>"}` for that section; any other keys beside `pane` go to the section. An id no enabled section has opens the window with the notice "That section is not available." The log keeps the id. The window remembers the last section while the shell runs.

## The window

- A Hyprland window titled System, of class `org.vgs.shell`. It opens floating and centred and takes the keyboard. Hyprland draws its border and moves, resizes, tiles and closes it like any other window.
- The sidebar holds a search field, the enabled sections under their group headings, and Shell & Plugins at the foot, which opens the Settings window to enable, disable and configure plugins.
- The page shows the section's icon and name, and Show in bar for a section with a bar widget: it puts the widget in the bar or takes it out, and leaves the section enabled. A section taller than the window scrolls.
- Only the shown section is built. Choosing another destroys the one before it, and closing the window destroys both.

## Keys

- The window opens with the keyboard in the search field. Typing filters the sections, and a letter typed anywhere in the sidebar goes to the search field.
- Up, Down, Page Up, Page Down, Ctrl+Home and Ctrl+End move the selection in the sidebar.
- Enter, or Right at the end of the search text, opens the selected section and moves the keyboard into it. Enter on Shell & Plugins opens Settings.
- Escape in a section returns to the search field. There, Escape clears the search, and with no search closes the window.

## Validation

`scripts/smoke/rows/system-window.sh` runs it in the nested sandbox over copies of a fixture section: the sidebar lists exactly the enabled sections in their groups and follows a section disabled while it is open, a deep link and a section's own link open their section, switching destroys the section before it, Show in bar places and removes the fixture's widget, a tall section scrolls, the window's edges line up within one pixel, it behaves as a Hyprland window, and the keyboard alone opens, moves, enters, leaves, searches and closes it. [docs/architecture/system-window.md](../../../docs/architecture/system-window.md) holds the contract.
