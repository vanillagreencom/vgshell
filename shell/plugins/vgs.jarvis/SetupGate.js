// Which setup step Jarvis offers while a command its setup needs is missing,
// pure so scripts/test-jarvis-setup-gate.js runs it under node. MISSING is
// the requirements capability's list: the plugin's declared commands the
// core's last scan did not find. A missing command is offered as Install on
// its own status row, which raises the core's requirement notice, and the
// setup step that needs it is withheld until a scan finds it.

// The value a setup reader publishes: its probe's VALUE while every command
// of REQUIRES is found, else a warning naming the missing commands that
// offers no action.

// while the last scan did not find it.
